I've seen some of the more obscure man-made problems sent by Tom Gage (i.e. under the stairs and in the corners.)  This is a great place to build forearm strength but a much better venue for meeting young college women.  Keep a secret?  Check out the underground sandstone block party behind Macky Auditorium.  M'kay.  BTW: Has anyone ever possessed the cajones to scale the Math building?\n\n"", ""\nThis is sweet! Free climbing while I'm at school.  There are plenty of challenges on the engineering building, including lots of cool traverses, man made cracks and stairs to climb, and a door traverse thats V3!  It rocks so try it out! \n\n"", ""\nCU is fun and you can get in a fast work our between classes. It is also shaded and usually has a nice breeze. If bouldering is a big waste of time you must either be wicked strong, don't need any help with endurance or your weak! I say the last one is your best bet.\n\n"", '\nhey buildering and bouldering both rock, who cares how the problem got there?  it just exists for the conquering.  Door traverses are fun, so are super highball math building climbs. :)  If you live in Boulder be sure to convince a crowd of chicks to gather cause i""ll be there next year conquering the math building ropeless.\n\n', '\nlooks like the math building was done in front range freaks and the guy got down by running down the roof. haven\'t seen the movie, but there is a quick blip of it in the trailer.  and to the previous AC...no shit it\'d be ""ropeless""\n\n', ""\nThere is a clip in Front Range Freaks of someone climbing the math building.  But the true challenge isn't that section.  Its the tower to the east of the section done in FRF.\n\n"", ""\nAC, in Front Range Freaks Timmy O'Neill scales the math building, then walks down the roof which is slanted at about a 45 degree angle.  The holds are huge and unless you fuck up it should be good to go. \n\n"", '\nTry Fort Lewis College if you need a CU break,,,The Union building is a solid 5.10...Cooper Hall area of the dorms have good portruding holds...Major portrusion!!!\n\n', '\nJust got hasseled by some middle aged professor type, his exact words were ""I wouldn\'t be doing that here, there\'s an all points [bulletin] for anyone skating, rollerblading, riding bikes, and climbing walls on campus."" I\'m a freshman here, but already I\'ve seen at least 15 different people climbing here as well as climbed here 4 or 5 times myself. What\'s the word, are they cracking down?\n\n', ""\nBecause I guess I started this banter, I want the last word here.  Buildering is not something we do because we're too weak to climb real rock.  We don't do it because we're too poor to go to The Spot.  We do it because it's there and we're there.  I would never imagine someone traveling to CU to check this stuff out.  I did it between math and physics classes, while everyone else out there was smoking or talking on cell phones.  I did it to unwind, out of boredom, not to replace free climbing.  Because we're climbers, something inside relentlessly prompts us to climb anything and everything, from the jungle gym in elementary school to the dorms at Williams Village ala Timmy O'Neill in FRF (That guy is missing a few bolts, I want to party with him!)  I loved it when he did the Daily Camera building because I've made renegade ascents on dozens of downtown buildings and never thought of that one.  Climbing is an impulse.  It's about freedom.  So don't let CU professors or anyone else scold you for buildering, don't let other climbers tell you what climbing is or isn't.  Monkeys in cages would probably prefer trees, and yet they continue to swing around their environment.    \n\n"", ""\nMy friends and I all climbed here in in our teens in the early eighties. We developed our forearm and crimp strength to give us the confidence to send the Eldo testpieces. We got hassled infrequently by the campus police. but now the Boulder po po seems to be in on the crackdown. They claim that it is against written campus law. Does anyone have any information pertaining to the legality of campus bouldering? Or any suggestions as to finding out the legal position on this subject? Our badass forefathers, founders of the sport, used to boulder here and it guiles me to think that this is yet another freedom lost to the Fascist Bastards. Does anyone have any experiences to share? P.S. Tom Gage is an old friend of mine, a solid dude of you're lucky enough to make his acquaintance. \n\n""]"

People should be free to do what makes them happy in nature (be it hike, or climb, or have sex with strangers) as long as nature is preserved.    Also on the initial description: There are many ways to hike into LOWER Dream Canyon from the Boulder Falls area, but climbing above the falls (as many a flatlander has done) can earn you a trespassing ticket from rangers (trust me).  From the parking area, cross the road down canyon from the ""hole in the rock"" and find the steep and narrow telephone service trail, try to avoid touron attention and be mindful of loose rock above the road.  Only use this trail to access lower Dream Canyon during high water, otherwise hike down from the upper canyon.  Be careful on all scree slopes and stay out of the mines, several have been filled in by the forest service during the last fifteen years but not all.  They are unstable and perilous.  Be discrete and respectful above the rim (i.e. top of Winter Warmth), it is private property.  \n\n', ""\nAnother way to get to Dream is by soloing the 4/5th class rock to the east of the falls. Just cross the creek and hike uphill a tad. I'm not sure if this is trespassing as well, but I can't imagine it is... Signs were on the West side of the creek, so... Lots of fun to do in wintry conditions/snow! Also, anyone know the name/grade of the 2 bolt route JUST right of the Falls? It runs up a blank wall with a roof, if I recall.

The next pitch continued diagonally right, then went up to a big overhang. I climbed over it by a tree, cranking up into the bottom of a short, right-facing dihedral (5.8).

From the base of the unknown, bolted route on its far right, I led up to the first bolt, then moved diagonally left along a ramp and up into a out-facing, 90-degree dihedral, through which I followed a crack trending right, around a roof or two, to the top. Call it ""Simi-taph"" (10a?). We set up a TR on said bolted route (five or six bolts, plus chainless two-bolt anchor, all with brown-painted hangers, following a steep, thin zig-zag crack).

Directly above the aqueduct, on the left side of the rock, Mike led up to the right side of a square-cut overhang (where a four-foot horizontal crack intersects a one-foot vertical crack), continuing up and right (10d+).

I went out tonight, and the tyrol appeared unchanged from when I tightened it a month or so ago.  The rock does not appear to have moved (no visible scratches between the boulders, etc.), the knots have not slipped (same amount of tail beyond the knots), and the tension in the line is enough to keep my 200 lbs well above the creek.  My feet were about 6' above the water when I stopped in the middle of the line.  So, what's going on?  I'm going to keep looking into it.  Perhaps this rope stretches significantly when it gets wet?  If people have climbed after a rain storm, perhaps the line stretches out more than when dry.  Some amount of stretch when wet would be normal, but someone reported their foot hitting the water.  That seems outside of a normal range for a static rope.  I'm not sure what the deal is.  I'll replace it with another rope if need be, but I'd hate to waste the rope until we know what's going on.

I had never seen a soul on this rock, other than myself, until BCN came out the next spring.  From that time on, it has been rather well frequented.  I have thought more than once about placing some good bolt anchors at the top of each route, but have never gotten around to it.  One reason is that for toproping, such anchors would be a little more dangerous to thread than the usual long slings from boulders and trees used until now.\n\n"", ""\nGreat area and great for beginners but IGNORE the directions used in the Knapp toproping book!  The mileages are completely wrong and the map is largely useless.  It took us two hours to find the place.  (The route beta in the book is okay AFAIK.)  Boulderado is located about a mile up the road from Boulder Falls at a right-hand bend with a ten-car parking area on the left side.  The climbing starts from a sloping ledge 40 feet above the road and the rock is obvious.  If you hike more than 50', you've gone too far.  The walkup for toproping is on the left.\n\n"", ""\nIn mid-March 2007, Richard Rossiter placed four new toprope anchors at the Boulderado, atop Jam It, Ho Hum, Idle Hands, and Mons. The Spot bouldering gym paid for the hardware and asked Richard to install the bolts and rings for the benefit of all users.  See Photo.  Richard, who has the first known ascents of these routes, has been thinking about installing anchors here for several years; see Comment.  Please don't toprope directly through the anchor rings; use your own gear instead.  And be extremely careful if you are at the top of this cliff and are not anchored in.  Personally, I prefer to lead these routes to set toprope anchors.\n\n"", '\nOne of the bolts at the top of ""Idle Hands"" is missing a hanger as of July 2, 2007.

We yelled up to warn whoever may have been above us of our presence but got no response.  I quickly ran left to grab some of gear over by ""Ruff Roof"" when I witnessed a huge amount of big rock come raining down over the mine hole (left of the first rockfall) and bounce down the hill.  Luckily, nobody was in its path, and no rocks made it to the road.  I have climbed here on several times since 1998 when I established ""Sofa Kingdom"". I scrambled to the top of the crag to bolt that line, and it was fairly solid rock.  I have never seen rockfall or felt it was a big concern until now.  I don\'t believe it was natural rockfall, and somebody set it off.  After moving everyone under a small overhang, I scrambled to the top to find the culprit but found no one. Lucky for them!  It would be difficult and dangerous to reach the anchors from above to set up a top-rope.  Generally these route are led.  There were hikers and a few lost climbers looking for Animal World that Sunday.

Once across the river, walk up hill until you see some cairns and then do your best to follow this to the top of the wall.  The cairns are easy to follow on the descent, but a little more difficult on the way up.  There is a faint trail in spots.  Don\'t bother with this approach if it looks like you can cross the creek at the Boulderado parking area.  A tyrolean would be nice to have near the Boulderado parking area, making it easy to get to Sleeping Beauty, the Beer Can, Trout Rock, and Black Widow.

Look for an opening in the trees and brush on the far side of the stream.  Cross here and pick up the North Trail above a short talus field.  NORTH SIDE TYROLEAN and THE NORTH TRAIL:  Find the tyrolean just upstream from the parking area for ANIMAL WORLD and the BOULDERADO.  Once across the stream, hike south into a talus field and look for a relatively clean line up the talus into a steep path that leads up toward the Beer Can.  Then follow a good trail east along the bottom of the wall.  The trail gets steeper toward the end and climbs to Ledge Two (the big ledge that runs across the Main wall) in the vicinity of the routes LIGHTSPEED and KAMA SUTRA.  WEST SIDE TYROLEAN and THE WEST TRAIL:  Find the tyrolean just downstream from the parking for Easter Rock. Once across the stream, look for cairns and an opening through the forest slope. Hike straight uphill for maybe 150 feet, then follow a long climbing traverse right for 200 feet.  Cairns lead back left into a narrow gully.  Hike up the gully, then break right and follow cairns (as usual).  This beautiful trail passes through open forest and leads to the top of Sleeping Beauty.

Great climbing on great rock with excellent protection.  I want to thank the folks that put these routes in.\n\n', '\nFor what it is worth, I think the climbing is pretty darn good for Boulder Canyon.  A tremendous amount of effort has been put into cleaning, flossing and in general creating a cliff which is very user-friendly with routes which are fun and interesting.  In a way it is even more aesthetic than before.  Sure the pitches are short and the bolts on an average of 6 feet apart but if some are skipped then the run-outs become more worthy of conversation.  Yep, there are lots of bolts next to cracks but once the bolts are skipped and the cracks plugged up with TCUs or stoppers, leading becomes more like it always should be: thoughtful and well, MORE thoughtful.  Trad climbing is possible because the cracks are clean.  And that pleases me.  My point here is that this is a cliff where trads and ""sport-to\'s"" can climb, come together and have a good time.  In a way it is a communal crag.  It isn\'t difficult to place passive gear, you just have to be strong enough, to have enough  ""spunk"" to overlook and disregard the bolts....  This is an engineered cliff where the creator (Ron?) has put in a lot of effort to clean and create an otherwise unclimbed cliff into what will be and is already a very popular destination.  I enjoyed my day of climbing here and I will return.  I\'ll tell all my friends about it. They\'ll come with their girlfriends and TRAINED, domesticated animals.  I hope they will clean up their poop.  It\'s good fun.  which is what most climbers want anyway and the direction climbing here is going.  Fun and a challenge.  Maybe not life-changing but who knows?  It\'s a chance to create something positive.  This crag development didn\'t happen in Yosemite, Eldorado or RMNP. No classic routes were discriminated against, and no one was hurt. Maybe there was the potential for radical life-changing routes but no one had put in the effort to find out.  AND the potential still exists..........  It isn\'t a bad thing.  It seems like the natural evolution of crag development in this area.  Why it could even become a positive step for relationships between climbers and land managers.  That\'s it.  The climbing is fun but for sure bring a trad rack because you can do that too.  Bring a pulley for the tyrolean across the stream but you can also walk across the water. It isn\'t deep.  Ignore the cheering crowds of tourists as you pull the 10d (or is it 10b?) crux over the roof because as much as the tourists annoy you, you also enjoy their adulation.  It\'s climbing in Boulder Canyon.  It\'s supposed to be fun! And it really is. And it\'s for everyone.  Jack\n\n', ""\nThe issue is not the cleaning, I think Paul Heyliger's comments sum it up very well and put this issue to bed.  The issue here in my opinion is the bolting of cracks and over bolting.  I climbed here yesterday and the climbing is awesome.  However, bolting cracks and over bolting are bad practices.  When you have a bolt at your feet, a bolt at your waist and are in arms reach of the next bolt something is not right.  To the individuals putting up routes here - PLEASE stop spraying bolts on gear protectable lines.  Let's avoid another Sport Park here.  Many of the lines need the bolts (less of them), but many do not need any at all.  Say no to Sport Park ethics!  All this aside, thanks to Ron and others for their efforts here, the climbing is very good.\n\n"", ""\nFriends and I went by this area again today and did a few climbs.  I don't know which ones we did 'cause we didn't have the guide.  It seems like people are helping clean up some the area at the bottom of the routes which is a good thing.  Nothing seemed amiss when viewed from across the creek. Again, the routes we did were very enjoyable.  Clean with good rock.  Regarding the number of bolts that protect the routes, yep there are a lot of them but no more than at Security Risk, Animal World, Black Widow and many other crags in this canyon.  As far as I can tell this has been the Bldr Cyn norm now for over ten years. The difference is that the cracks here have also been cleaned so you have that option; to protect with gear or with bolts.  Ya don't have to clip every bolt.  We didn't.  Have fun.\n\n"", '\nRon, A friend took me to Tonnere Tower the other day and we climbed many of your routes.  I thoroughly enjoyed my day there. I think the condition of the area, to include the trails and the routes, are well done. I was involved in much ""gardening"" back East in the late \'70s and early \'80s. These routes today see many, many climbers repeating what are now classics. \n\n', '\nWow, have been to Tonnere Tower and climbed most of the routes there and am surprised about the controversy above.  Are there signs of impacts from the climbing?  Yes, but the area (especially the base) looks to me pretty much like any other area.   Is it overcleaned and excavated?  Gosh, maybe, I did see signs of cleaning.  But for all you that must have adventure, be assured there is still loose rock up there.  We easily pulled a bowling-ball-sized, loose rock off (and were able to stuff it in an alcove where it is safe) just last week. So, as always, be careful.  All in all a nice area.  If I had a criticism I would say that some of the routes could have been put in as mixed gear and bolt routes.  But that\'s just me, I happen to like that kind of thing.  I did the top pitch of ""Staying Alive"" yesterday and took some gear and skipped some of the bolts.  That is no statement on ethics or anything I just wanted to do it as a mixed route and got exactly what I wanted.  I know I did not have the commitment factor cause I could always clip the bolts - so what.  If I had wanted to scare myself I would have done something dangerous.     I would like to say thanks to Ron and others for the work on the area.\n\n', ""\nWhy aren't more trad lines going up?  There is plenty of new rock to be climbed in Boulder Canyon but it seems that most of the new routes are sport.  Is it because the majority of climbers that are getting into rock climbing these days are sport climbers and sport climbers are mainly only interested in the physical aspect of climbing, not in the mental stress that comes with placing gear?   Trad climbers seem pretty complacent when it comes to first ascents in BC.  I've recently done a couple of new trad routes on Eagle Rock that are pretty good, but I don't know about many other FAs in Boulder Canyon that were put up in trad style.  Where have all the trad first ascentists gone?    Maybe some of the people who complain about too many sport routes going up should develop their own crag in Boulder Canyon.  I'd vote for that!\n\n"", ""\nI think that the main reason that people aren't putting up trad lines in Boulder Canyon is that there really aren't a lot of impressive lines.  The rock is very ledgy and inconsistent, and rarely is there a long section of impressive rock that gets the imagination flowing.  However, I think that this does provide an opportunity for moderate climbers to do so, but it seems that moderate climbers aren't as interested in putting up gear lines.  That's just my $.02.\n\n"", '\nI was trolling up and down Boulder Canyon today looking at rock which has yet to be developed or probably even climbed, and it reminded me that in order to put up new trad routes around here one would have to be willing to put in a lot of work.  Much of the remaining rock is dirty, the cracks may not be that great for protection, bushwacking of course to the base of the climb and maybe not climbing really hard grades.  Of course, most of us put up first ascents in the first place mainly for adventure and the thrill of going into the unknown but perhaps the majority of today\'s climber\'s prefer perfect rock, swooping flawless rock architecture and known difficulty.  That those are the most important qualities to most climbers around here. Maybe going to all the trouble to do trad FAs is just, well, too much work.  I don\'t know, I\'m just guessing.  There is a reason that Trad climbing is also refered to as ""Adventure Climbing"".  You just never know what you\'re going to run into and the addictive quality is getting into trouble and how you get back out of same trouble.     Of course Ron is attempting to develop a crag with something for everyone.  Even Tony.  And obviously, it\'s going to impossible to keep some climbers from claiming silly FAs or to keep others from complaining about this bolt being too close and that rating being wrong. I think there is still time for would-be trad first ascent leaders to grab their FA on this cliff if they are so inclined.  But if you aren\'t involved in putting up the routes or helping in some positive way then stop criticizing those who are.  Now is the time to help out with this cliff\'s development.  \n\n', ""\nJack is correct. It's true that it will take much more effort now to ferret out quality routes. I have been hiking around Boulder Canyon for weeks now, looking for new ground, and the best options are well hidden under moss and in more remote locations. Nothing short of elbow grease and commitment will reveal any of the few remaining gems.   Ron did this with Tonnere. He took a crate full of what many considered to be lemons that no one wanted, and he turned them into really good lemonade. Instead of beating the guy up for trying to contribute something good to the community, pick up your racks and make a your own contributions. It will be much more appreciated than the gratuitous criticisms.  \n\n"", '\nThough I told them in person, I wanted to publicly thank Ron and Bob for their work at Tonnere. Great lines -- many beginner-friendly -- and the luxury of hooks (instead of rings) at certain anchor points. Thanks for the time, effort, and imagination that went into making Tonnere a great spot.  - Dan\n\n', '\nYes, there are many bomber gear placements on some of the Tonnere Tower climbs and perhaps bolts should not have been placed at those spots. But I wonder how many of the critics would have ever given that crag more than a passing glance prior to its development...?\n\n', '\nI think the answer is pretty simple, Richard. Most of the critics have lived in the area, and they ignored it. Leo said that he thought about it but had more important things to do. Ron and Bruno looked at it, thought about it, reconned (<made up word) it, and then developed it. I think that about sums it up.   It went from being dormant to becoming an instantly popular destination as a direct result of their efforts. \n\n', '\nThe gardening criticism reveals naivete; apparently they have never had the pleasure of going up an uncleaned route, breaking off a hold, falling and bombing their belayer. And those complaining about bolt density should reflect on the alternative.  It was only after viewing route specific comments that I found acknowledgment of the effort to develop this area.  Thank you for making it safe and stabilizing the approach trail.  Beware of the boulder just upstream of the tree on the road side of the tyrolean.  Any more than one person standing on the stream side edge will tumble it (August 2008).\n\n', ""\nI would like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to Ron Olsen, Bruno Hache, Bob D'Antonio, Ken Cangi and others who contributed their considerable time, effort, expense and expertise to create the climbing routes that are now to be found on Tonnere Tower.

I have a print out from September with pictures and all, what happened?\n\n', '\nAs a contributor to the Boulder Canyon guidebook, I would like to say that the wholesale removal of route contributions to MP was a really bad idea. I would like to see MP figure out a way for this not to happen again. If you submit a route to the site, it should stay there unless there is a really compelling reason to remove it.\n\n', '\nIt\'s just bizarre, and seems to set a really bad precedent.  MP would barely exist if you removed all the routes that are already in guidebooks.  Isn\'t the slogan, ""beyond the guidebook""?  It would be nice to have some explanation--I\'m open to the possibility that we\'re missing something and there\'s a reasonable explanation.  Perhaps it\'s as simple as (1) any contributor has the right to remove his or her submissions for whatever reason, and (2) everyone who contributed route descriptions here actually chose to remove them?  At least, I hope it is something like that.\n\n', '\nI think this should head to the forum pretty soon so I\'ll add one more word here. The routes were not deleted but descriptions replaced with a reference to the guidebook, thus seeming to say, ""buy the book,"" and acting as a sort of paywall. The book is clearly superior  in the field, compared to printed-out MP descriptions but the MP descriptions are much more lengthy, detailed and often more useful than any guidebook would allow. The guidebook would have to be literally three times as thick and much more expensive. The two can coexist side by side.\n\n', '\nI posted a forum topic here: mountainproject.com/v/colorado...\n\n', ""\nI should add that Bob D'Antonio had nothing to do with this decision. I respect Ron's right to remove the descriptions, but the practical effect of the removal is substantial enough to question whether it's the best thing to do.\n\n"", '\nWhy can\'t we get at least one picture of the general overview of all of the routes on this crag? It\'s really annoying trying to figure out where to start when the only hint is ""Climb A is left of climb B."" I then followed the trail to climb ""F"" or so and discovered ""Climb F is left of the pine tree.""\n\n', '\nSo is there now a now a no beta photo policy here, or would someone else be allowed to put some up providing they took them and annotated them themselves, rather than simply reposted the old ones?\n\n', ""\nYou can totally put up your own. I would have if I've ever been.\n\n"", '\nFWIW, there is no ""no beta photo"" policy.  In brief, the individual (a former admin), who had posted the previous beta photos, removed them.  Beta photos are welcome.\n\n', '\nThere is now a sign warning climbers about them on the tree for the tyro. No problems today with them. A bit windy though.\n\n', '\nDoes anyone know how the weather would be here to climb during the first week of March?\n\n', '\nHey Steve, Tonnere faces north (northwestish) so could still be cold in March, but then again we do get warm days then. March can be very snowy in CO, though, so if it dumps, it will stick to the rock and tend to stay there for a while. Hope this helps...March is usually in the 50s and 60s in town, so 10 degrees less (and then factor in wind chill, possibly) in the canyon.\n\n', '\nProbably pretty chilly, and crossing the creek might be tricky, particularly if there is much snow.

Note - this was Tony Bubb's rock submission - Inca Stone was already in the database, so.... the info gets put here]  Details: Inca Stone is a ho-hum crag in Boulder Canyon, up past the Bihedral about an additional .25 miles on the North side. The broken and 'chunky looking' crag faces primarily south and is somewhat sheltered by trees. It's close proximity to the road (~150 yards) leads to plenty of road-noise. On the right side, the short cliff is slightly overhung and seemed to have stayed dry even in the light rain that was falling when I visited this crag.  The rock quality is somewhat dubious in many spots, and the routes are between only 25-55 feet tall. The routes on the right-hand side might have been left as boulder broblems, were it not for the cleaver sitting below them at the base. Instead, one has 2 bolts and a bolted belay, for a mere 20' of climbing.   There are sport and trad routes there, but just a few of each. While a couple of the routes are not too bad, their short length prevents then from being noteworthy.  Maybe this is a good crag to visit on a rainy day or to practice rope-work at. It is far from being a desireable climbing destination, with all of that good rock so closely nearby.  Get There: Go up Canyon Road from Boulder about .25 miles past The Bihedral, and pull over on the South side of the road. Walk back down on the road (east) until a less-steep area beside the road appears. The trail to the cliff base from there is evident, but not obvious. Walk up and left to the base of the cliff on either side, but it is hard to appraoch from the center.   \n\n"", '\nWe climbed at Inca Stone (aka Truth or Consequences) for the first time yesterday. I thought it was well worth a visit if you can climb hard 10 to 11. The right side had good sun until 3pm despite being relatively low down. The sun was just skirting the top of the ridge on the other side of the canyon. The left side was shady due to trees. The ""window"" is a mini natural wonder, and it\'s worthwhile hiking up to see that even if you don\'t plan to climb. It\'s likely that the name, ""Inca Stone"", is based on this natural window/arch.\n\n']"

Allen', 'George Bracksieck', 'Fiona Dunne']","[""\nI worked on this little crag for kids between September 2011 and Dec. 2012. I wanted to create a place for micro-adventures for children and their parents. I left some fixed ropes and nuts while working it that have been removed by someone else.  As a Boulder trad climber for over 35 years, I did not want excessive bolting to marr the aesthetics of this little area. So I have carefully thought about each and every bolt I hand drilled (4 total): three on the blank slab (for three different routes) and 1 at the top belay. I believe this spartan style creates a mixed-pro route that will be safe yet adventurous for young climbers and their parents.  Since I learned to  climb in the 1970s, I planned the top anchor to be 1 bolt and 1 fixed hex in a good crack, equalized and with rap rings, but I now realize that wasn't the best idea since someone else removed the hex and rap rings. So, currently the safest way off is by walk off descent to the south until I get the top anchor safe for rappel/top rope.  Thanks for your patience with my efforts to create a bus accessible, family-style crag for youngsters.  More route photos to come....\n\n"", ""\nScott,  Thanks for your work on this crag, it made for a very memorable Father's Day for my son and me!        Asher crushing it.

Yes, that is Fiona's Route.\n\n"", ""\nEach of the routes here is much longer than the stated 40 feet.  With the possible exception of the two easy routes farthest left (which I didn't do), each of the routes climbs about 65 to 75 feet from the ground to the one-bolt anchor (where you can add a hex, cam, or big stopper to back up the anchor bolt).  We brought a 100-foot rope and had to walk off after every lead.   About six feet left of the start of Fiona is a vertical seam with two fixed KBs.  This is directly beneath the bolt on Fiona.  To climb directly from the undercut start, up to the first pin is at least 5.11.  To start a few feet farther right, bouldering up, then moving left to clip the pin is maybe 5.9-.  After bouldering up from the ground, placing a small wire or RP before continuing up and left to the second pin may be better than reaching down and to the left to clip the first pin.  Is this the route Heads or Tails??\n\n"", ""\nI enjoyed the routes, but I do not think this is a good place for a first lead if you're looking to gain experience placing pro. I came here hoping to get lots of practice placing pro but actually only found 2 or 3 opportunities to do so per route, excluding building anchors. The runouts did make it more exciting though! Also watch out for loose and potentially loose big blocks on top. Unknown Left Side at Happy Hour Crag would be a much better first lead in my opinion (but I am not child-sized, so I can't comment on how hard it is for kids).\n\n""]"

Although a small corner of a major crag I submit for review by the community a resampling of these minor routes so that the record can be corrected in future editions of the local guides.

As for the ratings, what is the complaint exactly?\n\n', ""\nAs for the grades here, they seemed fine to me.  I've climbed both Peter's Out and Siberian Khatru (as well as almost everything else there below 5.12) and I thought that Siberian might be a little bit tough, but arguably reasonable.  In my opinion it isn't a total sandbag- 5.9, I thought.  Having done 500+ other routes in Eldo, I believe that most of the rest of the grades on Hawk-Eagle are fair by comparison.

Beware in particular the route ""Stranglehold, 5.7"" (left of Cinch Crack).  In Rossiter this route does not have an ""S"", but it definitely deserves one.  That is one scary 5.7, assuming we went the right way!

This is also part of the East Slabs descent. It's very dangerous on either side of the chockstone although you could, of course, belay it.  The west side of Redgarden has those major wooden steps and a metal ladder, but that's for erosion control. Seems like a ladder here at the base of Hawk Eagle Ridge would be justified.\n\n"", ""\nI agree with Matt on this one.  Bad idea.  Unjustified.  Not dangerous unless you don't know what you're doing.  The other ladders mentioned were put in due to a washout of the prior trail by a rainstorm.  As you say, it can be belayed if felt necessary.  It would be another example of a convenience item that would detract from the natural beauty of the location.  No, please, no.\n\n"", ""\nI'd have to agree with the 'no ladder' stance.

I've seen 2 dogs make it up the slabs to the left, so all in all, I'm going to have to say it's not that hard.\n\n"", '\nI too would vote against the ladder for a couple of reasons.  First, it is neither the hardest nor most dangerous part of the East Slabs descent.  The upper slab part where it is ""easy"" is probably the most dangerous part as a slip would likely be fatal, and it is not so easy when running with water and threatened with lightning.  Second, the chimney past the chockstone is pretty easy when dry and is somewhat protected from getting wet in storms.  The slab on the left is hairy when wet.  Third, a ladder would be hard to conceal and you might even be able to see it from the parking lot.  It does seem like the chimney side has grown smoother over the years, there are some huge handholds at the top of the chimney but they\'re pretty rounded.  Perhaps a discrete rap anchor would make more sense for when there is a storm.  I think if the chimney was wet there wouldn\'t be anybody wanting to go up it.\n\n', '\nI agree that a ladder would not be a good idea.   Before I knew one could downclimb the chockstone side (first time down the East slabs descent) I tried to descend the slab side (Downclimbing right). That time of year, I found it covered with slime and seeping with water so we rapped the slab (I think from a tree that had slings).   As we were rapping, we saw a couple of climbers downclimb the chocksotne side and realized it was not as hard as first thought.  So, in case you are not feeling like downclimbing the chockstone and the slab is wet, you can still rap it. No need to add bolts or ladders.  Now if you are caught in a strom, you better head for higher ground and wait it out cause either way of descending could get you killed.  I have heard that there are some awesome rockslides in this gully when it rains...

This fact alone caused me to resolve some time ago never to climb Anthill Direct again, even though I consider it among the best routes I've ever climbed.  Anyone who has descended the east slabs knows what I mean--they are at best extremely annoying and at worst extremely dangerous.  Here's a far superior alternative:  Find the cairn marking the beginning of the east slabs descent at the flat spot just north of the top of Anthill Direct (or, if you've topped out on Redgaurd, in the cleft between tower 2 and the top of the south buttress, look south for this flat spot with a cairn).  Go there.  Climb UP the 3rd class slab perhaps 75 vertical feet to their top, traverse around the west (left) side of a small pinnacle, and you'll find yourself due east, and about 50 vertical feet above, the saddle between tower 1 and tower 2 (this is where Ruper tops out).  From here proceed (some 4th class) to the chockstone chimney/vertigo rappel route, the best description for which appears in the first comment (by Charles Vernon) in the Yellow Spur beta on this site.  One caveat re: the chockstone chimnet/vertigo rappels:  if you are not familiar with them, it can be challenging to find the bolted rappel anchors.

This area goes into the shade in the late afternoon and can be cool and pleasant on those long, hot, Front Range, summer evenings when the Monkey is blazing in the sun. With the peripheral boulders (Jim Hall Boulder, That Flakes It, 30th Birthday Roof) found in this secluded ""nook"", you can make for a good session in the V3 to V5 zone. Chill out, enjoy yourself and imagine trying the Westside Traverse in Kronhoffers with Layton.\n\n', ""\nDoes anyone know what the hard, overhanging problem on the southeast corner is? It's a beautiful line requiring seriously strong fingers.\n\n"", ""\nKris, I'm guessing here, but I suspect you are talking about Butt Slammer, since it is the most obvious and inspiring (except for the rock quality) line on the boulder. Butt Slammer was put up by Rob Candelaria in 1974/75 and ascends the steep and airy southeast overhang above a small slab that faces downhill. At the time, it was rated B1+, which usually equates with V5 or 6 for most of Ament's ratings. Unfortunately, the rock is not the best and, shortly thereafter, a critical flake broke and several others have broken since. The glue has not helped to keep the flakes in place, which supports the position that if a hold breaks, no matter how critical ... such is life, leave the rock alone. Anyway, I digress ... Although Benningfield's CO Bouldering calls Butt Slammer V10, to my knowledge ... nobody's done it since it broke in the mid 1970s.  Other Nook's Rock Beta:  Colin Lantz established a line in 2004 that begins down and right from Butt Slammer at the bottom of the arete and rides the arete to Butt Slammer's topout. He called it Slut Bammer and he called it V6 or 7.  There is another hard problem established by Will LeMaire in 2005 called Window Shopper on the left side of the east overhang which more or less faces east or downhill towards the road and town. It begins on the far left on the lowest sidepulls and moves up and right past some painfully small and sharp grips to a topout on top of a short bulge. This is a hard problem that he originally thought was V12, but then backed off to say V10 or 11.  Finally, there is the traverse across the northeast face. For whatever reason, Benningfield's guide refered to this as the Westside Traverse V5, but it is quite a bit harder and not on the west side. Anyway, most people do Nook's Traverse as follows: Traverse L->R from obvious holds on the far left and up Wimpie's Revenge (the obvious shallow dihedral on the right). Consensus puts this at V8. A low sds further down and left moves into the line and ups the grade to V9 or so.  Everybody have fun....\n\n"", '\nThis is a great place to take a beginner for an intro to some bouldering and a great ""date climb"" spot, too.\n\n', '\n\n\n']"

Yesterday the weather was cloudy, misting, and light rain all day, so I figured instead of letting the weather shut me down like it has for about 2 weeks now I would go aid China Doll.  Seeing as I have never been to Dream Canyon, this was probably a bad idea. We missed the correct approach and basically ended up right in the middle of the canyon below upper and above lower.    The problem was that we had no idea what we were on top of at the top and there is a ton of spur trails. The tops of the cliffs didn't present any distinct land marks to navigate from (we didn't know what cliff was which as you can't see the face from above) and it was unclear which drainage was the correct one to descend. We went way too far east in an attempt to find a for sure safe way down. The problem was we didn't want to slip on top of a big dome or slab of rock and end up at the bottom dead, or get cliffed out by taking the wrong way down. So, we just took the obvious main trail down to the bottom. Up the creek we went, crossing like 5 times I was sure glad I left my pack up top...not.    We arrived at the Lost Angel super exhausted not to mention running out of time, only had time to link the first 2 pitches and lower/back clean.  I didn't climb at all, just a horrendous walk in a soaked canyon. with extra warm clothes and tons of gear for nothing! I guess at least my friend got some more aid experience, but at what price?  We came back up the ramp and saw another option we were considering for descent earlier, definitely cliffed out but was probably less then 100 yards from the ramp. For some reason we thought that deadly option was the dream dome descent but actually we were atop midnight instead of the LA.  I hope I can find the ramp next time as there wasn't much that was really distinct about where we popped out.  So, the lesson, expect to waste a day (or maybe just part of the day if you start early enough) just finding the formation/route you want to climb here as navigation can suck. Probably good practice for descending into the black canyon on a smaller scale.  How many others have been lost here? I bet I'm not the first by a long-shot.  Studying the contour of the river (in relation to the map in your guidebook) seemed helpful after the fact. We figured that out while we were lost in the bottom wondering where we were. \n\n"", ""\nYep, I got lost, too.  Don't go here for the first time if you are under any time constraint.

And I'm really looking forward to Cosmosis, Avalon, Upper Dream Canyon, etc. But for the pure joy of fun in the sun rock climbing, this area has it. Excellent rock quality, safe routes, various styles and spectacular position well above the road are a few of the reasons I like this place so much. I even like the 3rd class approach. It adds a sense of remoteness and adventure to an area so easily accessed. The ledge is a comfortable, clean and fairly spacious spot as opposed to a lot of base areas that are dirty, slanted and trashed. Helmets are probably a good idea, especially when there are a lot of other climbers, but that is true of most areas in the canyon.  My first climb here was Rhodian Shores. I didn't have a guidebook and it looked like a nice, direct line. There were parties on some of the other lines to the left, so we jumped on it. I was a little surprised to find out later it was a 10b. At the belay, I got to watch a guy lead the first pitch of the Bihedral Arete.  Wow, it really looked spectacular from that vantage point. I was obsessed with doing it. It took 4 attempts to complete both pitches, because of rain, and partners. I finally ended up leading both pitches, after leading the first one 3 times. It's a climb I would go back to any time. It looks so improbable from the road. It's hard to believe it goes at 10a. Can't wait to do the second pitch of Rhodian (10a) and the routes to the right of the Arete.\n\n"", ""\nWhat are the mixed/trad routes to the right of It's Time For a Change? There seems to me  finger crack to the right which merges to the anchor, then a bigger crack going right of the main corner at a horizontal, then up a shallow dihedral and crack up to set of higher anchors. Anyone know?\n\n"", '\nHello all, I lost a draw here yesterday (Saturday, November 20th). If you find it, please contact me and I will describe it.

It has great variety: multi-pitch trad, sport, steep faces, slabs (scary and not), even some halfway decent cracks.  This crag is fairly complex -- better have a guidebook and as of this writing, contains far more worthy routes than are listed on this site.  With predominately southern exposure, it is a good cold weather crag; the rub is that it tends to receive a raptor closure around the beginning of February .  On the plus side, this closure tends to be lifted earlier than most.\n\n', ""\nWhat's the deal with all the raptor nesting closures?!

The route Where Eagles Dare was named after the nest you about belay from at the base of the last pitch.  It think it's been like that since the 70s or 80s.  It has certainly been that way for the 90s.  I went by the (unoccupied) nest for my first time in the late fall of 1995 with Gary Stettler, after the seasonal closure was lifted.  While your statement of the current condition is exagerated, it does call into question our fate- we close 1/5 of the cliffs for an endangered species to recover them- what happens when their population recovers and there are 5X as many?  This is a long term concern.    Territorial behavior is the only thing that will keep them off of EVERY cliff, but surely you can expect regulations to decrease, or closures to increase.\n\n"", '\nI don\'t get it: while Blob is closed to a few (mostly environmentally friendly) climbers, we\'re spending millions of dollars a year paving and maintaining roads in National Parks so that every yahoo with an RV, a generator, and a six pack of macro beer can enjoy the ""wilderness.""  Kind of frustrating, not to mention hypocritical, if you ask me.

Cliffs get closed without any sign of birds on a yearly basis.And now it is creeping into other critters as well - there are even closures for bats up in the Flatirons.At Ralston Buttes, the crag is closed year-round for no particular animal - it is ""a sensitive study area"", whatever that means.   This would be merely irritating if there were ANY scientific evidence that the raptors were negatively impacted by climbers.  However, since there is absolutely no evidence to support that position, the vast majority of these raptor closures are just downright stupid.    The Access Fund is a group that I support with my fees, and I think they do a good job.They do a lot of good things and have done a great job of buying up properties and access rights on threatened crags.But with respect to closures, they are extremely weak.Their efforts to ""work with"" certain land management agencies (Jeffco Open Space, Boulder Open Space, the idiots that run Hueco, etc.) would best be replaced with aggressive litigation.    The Access Fund may support raptor closures, but the only reason they do this is to placate land managers that can\'t be placated.  They should get some balls, start a legal defense fund, and challenge every single one of these closures in court.   \n\n', '\nThanks Richard - totally agree.  I was talking about this with a friend and his comment was that we should be happy that more is not closed (implying that there are grounds to close more).  What a load.  I would love to start seeing litigation against some of these nazi land managers on power trips.  I can just see their self-righteous behavior about the whole thing right now.  The government sucks.\n\n', ""\nMy friend's car got borken into at the Blob Rock parking spot  a few weeks ago.  I would recommend parking at the Cob Rock lot and walking over for better car  securtiy (it's only about 50 feet away).I think the Cob lot offers more visibility and it's more populated, both of which could dissuade thieves. \n\n"", '\nThis is a response to Richard Magill\'s post stating that there is no evidence of climbing negatively affecting raptors.  A few years ago a friend and I did a route in late May at Castle Rock in the Platte.  The access to this crag is from Wellington Lake, a fee area.  The woman who collected our 3$ told us to stay away from the climb with nesting falcons.  We asked if you she tell us the specific route or at least crag the birds were nesting on.  She could not, but said the nest would be ""obvious"".  We proceded to our route, which I believe was ""The Throne Room"", saw no sign of nesting and began climbing.Throughout the first two pitches, falcons loudly screeched from adjacent cliffs.  At the end of the stretcher 2nd pitch, I pulled into the belay hole to find a nest containing two unhatched large eggs.I was unhappy about this arrangement, but was unwillingly to abandon the route and make 2 raps from (my own) gear anchors, so I established an anchor with gear above the the hole and my feet resting on the edge of it; this was likely the most common way to rig this belay and the most expeditious, which in view of the threatening weather, was a concern.  I brought my partner up, explaining the need for delicacy in the vicinity of the belay.We were not swinging leads, so the belay changeover was protracted; in the hurry to outrace the weather -- we eventually pulled buzzing ropes from the summit rappel and, in shirt sleeves, were pounded by hail on the ensuing raps --  my partner forgot about her out-of-site feet in the hole and stepped on the nest,  crushing an egg.    Hard not to call that a negative impact.\n\n', ""\nYes, I would agree that actually climbing through the nest and breaking eggs is a negative impact.I would not recommend climbing on a line with a nest on it.   However, I don't see any scientific evidence that climbing a line nearby (say even 10 feet away) has any impact on raptors.  So if there is one nest on a crag, why close the whole crag?  Why not just close the line with the nest (and maybe some adjacent ones).Closing all of Blob Rock over one or two nests just doesn't make any sense. \n\n"", '\nAre 3 and 8 transposed in the topo?  I thought the lost Flatiron was between Sherwood and Cob.\n\n', '\nIn response to climber\'s impacts on raptor nesting:  While there may not have been an environmental impact assessment done on climbers per se, full with population parameter data, the negative impact of humans on nesting birds is clear.  As mentioned by ""anonymous coward"", the raptors were ""screaming"" at the climbing duo for the length of the climb.  This means that the female was not sitting on the eggs during this time.  Incubation is CRITICAL for the developing egg.  Raptors are extremely sensitive to humans.  Humans anywhere near a nest-- whether it\'s climbing the line the nest is on, or anywhere near it, will disrupt the mother.  Stress during incubation can damage the embryonic development of the chicks; stress on the parents following hatching of the eggs can damage the natural development of the chick, and may lead to an early death.  Developing birds are fragile.  Further, remember back to your basic ecology.  Raptors are K selected species-- long-lived, slow reproducers.  Their populations don\'t explode like rabbits.  Their populations are fragile, and without nesting protection, can crash quickly.  I think the birds might say to you, Stefan, get your own rock.  And since they live there and need to reproduce there, and there\'s plenty more rock in Colorado, maybe you should.\n\n', ""\nPaul, I believe the topo to be correct. If my memory serves (and the website seems to confirm this), 200 yards west of Cob Rock is Sherwood, then another 100 yards west lies the approach for the Lost Flatiron. I find it easier to walk along the road and use Sherwood's Tyrolean as opposed to Cob Rock's. You avoid scrambling over the boulders at Cob's base.~Wm\n\n"", ""\nAnecdotal stories about the impact of humans on raptors are apparently easy to come by.However, my point remains the same - there is NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE of any negative impact.Point me to a statistically valid study - there aren't any.  And as far as anecdotes go, I've seen bald eagles living just fine on a Broomfield golf course.  Peregrines do well living on downtown sky scrapers.    Stefan is right - the raptor closures are silly.  Boulder area land managers frequently close cliffs without any active nests.   I like raptors as much as anyone, but the bottom line is that these closures are not based on scientific evidence. \n\n"", '\nMy friend and I encountered an anchor not listed in the Falcon guide to Boulder Canyon at the top of (what the Falcon guide calls) Blacklight.

There are at least two classic routes--Anthill Direct and Redguard--that finish at the top of the south buttress of Redgarden Wall.  The current guidebooks, and the beta on this site, all suggest that the east slabs are the ONLY viable descent from these, and other, routes that top out on the south buttress.  This fact alone caused me to resolve some time ago never to climb Anthill Direct again, even though I consider it among the best routes I've ever climbed.  Anyone who has descended the east slabs knows what I mean--they are at best extremely annoying and at worst extremely dangerous.  Here's a far superior alternative:  Find the cairn marking the beginning of the east slabs descent at the flat spot just north of the top of Anthill Direct (or, if you've topped out on Redgaurd, in the cleft between tower 2 and the top of the south buttress, look south for this flat spot with a cairn).  Go there.  Climb UP the 3rd class slab perhaps 75 vertical feet to their top, traverse around the west (left) side of a small pinnacle, and you'll find yourself due east, and about 50 vertical feet above, the saddle between tower 1 and tower 2 (this is where Ruper tops out).  From here proceed (some 4th class) to the chockstone chimney/vertigo rappel route, the best description for which appears in the first comment (by Charles Vernon) in the Yellow Spur beta on this site.  One caveat re: the chockstone chimney/vertigo rappels:  if you are not familiar with them, it can be challenging to find the bolted rappel anchors.  Either have done it before or make sure you study the beta carefully, otherwise you may have difficulty finding the anchors.\n\n""]"

After some experimentation, I've decided that for me the following is themost aesthetic way to do it. Thought I'd post it here in case anyone else is intothis sort of thing.  Start with Regency Slab (both pieces). After the 10' downclimb continue straightWest and you'll get to an F2 or so chimney slot, which deposits you at the baseof the East face of Royal Arch.  Climb the E. face of Royal Arch. The West side is downclimbable for better climbersthan me (30 feet or so of 5.6). When I was last there there weren't any anchors (justa single hangerless bolt). In this case, it's easy to reverse the top part of the E. face and step to the south arriving at a spot very close to where hikers oftencongregate.  Now walk a couple of hundred yards (this is the longest walk you have to do) downthe Royal Arch trail to the N. until you pass the bottom of Tangen Tunnel and thestart to the first piece of the Fourth Flatiron.   Climb the first piece of the Fourth Flatiron, and then get onto the second piece atthe standard start.  Don't, however, do the standard route on the fourth. Stay to the right, on clean rock. The central gash for which the standard route heads is 100' or so to your left,and you basically climb straight up from the start (the standard route traversesleft from the start). Above you after several hundred feet is a big (3') crack witha tree in the bottom. To the right of that is a nice looking crack diagonalling right,which I haven't climbed. The 3' crack splits a steeper section. You can getinto this crack and do an easy chimney with big holds about 30' past the tree atthe bottom (I'd estimate F5 in difficulty, if that). Above this are some more trees,and you're past the steep section on normal Flatiron steepness. Diagonal right at this point and step into Fern Alley (an F2 in Roach's guide) about 60' from itsstart.  The wall to the right (north) of you is the start to the E. Face of G. Mtn Pinnacle. Do thisroute according to Roach's description. If you have a rope, you can rappel off the topto the West, otherwise don't go all the way to the top (or reverse the last part, aswith Royal Arch), and step into the big crack that splits Green Mtn. Pinnacle (that contains Green Mountain chimney). Walk through this until you emerge at the West at the base of Challenger.  Now climb Challenger.  What I do at this point is continue on to the Eastern summit ridge of G. Mtn. Fromhere it's a super nice hike, staying slightly to the W and crossing several easyshoulders of the mountain, to join up with Greenman trail as it descends from thesummit (you're close to the summit at this point). I then just follow the Greenmantrail down Gregory Canyon, and back to Chautauqua trailhead that way. The directdescent from the summit of Challenger, back to the Royal Arch trail, has never appealedto me. This way is a little longer, but much nicer. If you feel like it, you can angleto the West near the top of Gregory Canyon, and cross over to Flagstaff for a littlebouldering on the way down.  FWIW - I think this is one of the best Flatirons days I've had!  \n\n"", ""\nGreat link-up Greg. I have done this same one as well but had to split it into two days. The Challenger would be climbed for P2. P1 is uninteresting except for a sling on a tree branch for pro. P2 has a serious runout and would be better if brushed or if more popular. Combining the grit, runout, and lichen, I'd rather tell someone it was 5.5 friction slab so they'd have better beta. - Jay P.\n\n"", ""\nEither Green Mountain Pinnacle should be in North or this this should be in Central? Either way, to find Challenger if you've never been over here first find D&T on GMP and the walk uphill for 50 yards or so.\n\n""]"

If you scramble to the base of the 1911 gully, you will have to go back down to reach the start of the standard east face route on Queen Anne's Head.

We added quick links and chain for rappel.  The hardware for this work was provided by the American Safe Climbing Association (www.safeclimbing.org).  They appreciate your support.\n\n', '\nHow to get there: First, decide that this rock looks like a great place to enjoy a day out with some less than experienced good friends (4 total).  It\'s multipitch but not so many as to make you worry about running out of daylight; access seems easy enough.  Bit of a hike, a few bits of poison ivy, but nothing difficult.  And easy enough to relax and help your friends. Second, print out the directions from Mountain Project, and a trail map from Rock Climbing Colorado figuring most of these guys are good, even George Bell, well-experienced in the area, chimed in, so if there are any big worries, he would\'ve mentioned it. Third, start hiking, go right past the sign that says ""Access Trail to 2nd/3rd Flatirons"" because you figure that can\'t be the way.  If it was the poster wouldn\'t have put ""take the FAINT trail to right past the possibly dry stream"" (note, THAT stream, not the other half dozen that look the same) the original poster would\'ve said ""Take that obviously well maintained trail with a big sign that says ""Access Trail to 2nd/3rd Flatirons"". Fourth, make your friends climb up and down the steep trail next to Queen Anne\'s Head, with the painful gully in between, looking for a some place that is not completely covered in poison ivy.  Make sure to attempt a few crossings to be denied by the ivy, further discouraging the two girls, who have expressed they don\'t even want to try the crossing.   Fifth, meet a couple of rangers that can\'t remember the way across either.  Explore a bit south of the steepness, and determine there\'s just a somewhat loose boulderfield to cross after scrambling up the hill.  After thoroughly wearing out the two girls, send them happily on their way (with their share of the gear of course) back to the car and to Pearl Street for cheeseburgers and beer.   Sixth, energized from moving as a group of two, and your friend who\'s fine scrambing, scramble up the slope and head across the field of fist-sized loose rocks that seem to have it in for your Teva exposed toes.  Reach the side of a really big rock in front of you...  you look down and see nothing but a sloppy steep (though only about 20 feet deep) gully filled with poison ivy, and see no real way to avoid it.  So, you think maybe it is possible just a small rock to get around (because you of course have never been to the 3rd) and skirt underneath the 3rd to Queen Anne\'s head.  So, you head up and around only to find out the rock is definitely a part of the Third.  You find a nice platform with other climbers taking off halfway up the Third.............refusing to feel dejected the two of you will declare that Queen Anne\'s Head is nothing but a figment of the imagination, that it doesn\'t really exist, and there is no way to get to it even if it did exist.  And of course notice the nicely blazed and obvious trail leading to the Third couldn\'t possible be the faint trail.  You drop your rope and start cruising up the third happy with thoughts that this was your plan all along.\n\n']"

Perhaps since we thought it was just a flatirons jaunt and thus maybe a 30 minute approach.... allow 1 1/2 - 2 hours for the approach, especially the first time - we got lost.    When you get to the talus (30 yards off the trail) - head DUE NORTH - don\'t get sucked up and into the talus - you\'ll find the trail which expands to a road, then probably 300 yards along see a faint trail heading straight up.

Grant it, there was not a lot of rope left, but it was comfortable enough. Also, there was no wind the day we did this.  Now, I have heard horror stories of people being swung out by the wind away from the crow's nest and having to time the descent with the variations in the wind... Needless to say this would be even more horrific if all you had left were 10 feet of rope as you swung over 100ft of air...  So, make sure your rope was cut to the appropriate length at the factory and tie them ends. Enjoy the rush... Lot's of nervous giggling usually follows the first rappel...\n\n"", ""\nWho needs a GPS when you can do it the old fashioned way?  Here is the info you've been waiting for:  As described above, the Shadow Canyon Trail intersects the Mesa Trail at an obvious water trough.  From the Mesa Trail, take between 192 (for taller folks) and 233 (for shorter folks) steps up the Shadow Canyon Trail.  Then, head right through the trees and poison ivy to the quarry.  Follow my directions from there.  I didn't time us on the way in, but the hike out took exactly 1 hour (very casual pace) from the bottom of the Maiden to the South Mesa trailhead.  Of course, it's mostly all mellow downhill.\n\n"", ""\nMyke is actually describing a slightly different approach in his comment.  It sounds to me like he is saying to continue further up the Shadow Canyon Trail, then head right and walk directly to the quarry road.  This way may indeed be better, but it probably doesn't matter too much.  Heck, the first time I tried to get there I ended up thrashing around below the Fatiron, so any way is better than that.

The weather was great before the last pitch yesterday on the North Ridge.  It got very windy and made the rappeller feel as if being dropped from a helicopter.  It was hard to hit the crow's nest and even harder to pull the ropes.    We couldn't pull them and had to rap from the summit to the bottom and get the ropes this morning when the wind died down.\n\n"", '\nAnother approach (as showed to me by Josh Janes):This is a nice alternative, but may not save any time. Go up this way and down one of the other ways to do a loop.Immediately after starting up the Mesa Trail, turn left on the Towhee Trail. Follow this good trail steadily up until it joins the Shadow Canyon trail (a good dirt road). Turn left on the Shadow Canyon trail, pass below the Matron, and pass some structures, until you are at the mouth of Shadow Canyon (small stream crossing here). Turn right on a small trail (with sign) that connects to the Mesa Trail. This is the same ""Shadow Canyon"" trail mentioned above. Gently down (not too much elevation loss), until you come to the flat quarry ""road"" mentioned by Myke above.\n\n', ""\nMake sure you take the third Shadow Canyon turnoff from the Mesa Trail.  I got confused because I hit 2 turnoffs to Shadow Canyon before giving up because I thought maybe the water trough was gone (it won't be, quite permanent).

If, like me, you only brought one rope, there is a ledge part way down on which I put a fairly minimalist but adequate anchor (small tree backed up by an even smaller tree, new 1"" webbing, one carabiner). A single 60 meter will get you from the top to this ledge, and from this ledge to the ground with lots of rope left over on both raps.

I'm a little befuddled as to why the OSMP ranger would prefer the Slab route as I found it to be pretty nonexistant as a trail and the route seemed to go through some sensitive areas such as the thick stand of five foot ferns and the deadfall area. Is it better to bushwhack through those areas (I wish I had a machete) or use the well worn trail up the ridge from the Mesa Trail? I did note that there are no trail markings adjacent to the Mesa Trail for at least a hundred yards to the west, so it's not likely that much of the general public would find their way up there. Also, I noted a large proliferation of flag markers in the area of the Mesa-to-Terrain route, what kind of work is going on up there and why the hundreds of flags?\n\n"", ""\nI don't know anything about the flags or the work being done, but I, too, have just this summer abused myself by bushwhacking through the stand of five foot tall ferns.  My conclusion: we're the only people near nuts enough to go up there in the heat of the summer and it's usually a winter destination when the ferns die off.  I think I'll definitely be heading up there a bunch this winter and I am sure that the slab approach will be far less severe.  I've also done the east ridge approach as I knew nothing of the access angst regarding this area at first, and found it to be much more amiable.  I think the reason it gets the flak it does is because it's an Open Space park and the trail that would surely be created by the boulderers is not a sanctioned open space trail (i.e. it is an obviou ssign of RULE BREAKING!).  I bet if we could get it passed, the OMSP would have no problem with letting us build a quality trail up there.  They probably just think the ones there are already good enough.  Anyone wanna start a petition?\n\n"", ""\nI was at the Terrain Boulders yesterday with my partner and a bear was strolling about, just 20-30 yards away.

The First Tier is not too formidable and is host to 9 routes that all face west on two different levels.    The Second Tier is more difficult to visualize and is host to 33 routes on a series of walls and slabs facing west and south that are stepped upward from left to right beginning with the Tarot Wall and ending with Wall of the Dead.   The Third Tier is host to 29 routes on five distinct facets: The Northeast Face, Wall of the Dragon, the West (or Upper) Gully, Wall of the Goddess and the Southwest Buttress with the route Black Tiger.  The broad Northeast Face includes the following 15 routes (all of which face northeast):  Crack Love Crack Love II Crack Love III The Art of War The Enemy Within Thus Us War Horse Ancient Fright Resurrection Ancient Light Blade Ghost Ship Ship of Fools Mystery Tour Mystery Ship   The West (Upper) Gully is host to five routes. To the right of Mystery Ship, the wall bends around to face west and climbs to a notch just east from the balanced rock atop the Wall of the Goddess.  A fairly amazing chockstone or fallen block hovers over the gully to the south of the notch.  The west-facing Wall of the Dragon is located directly above the West Gully and is host to just two routes, or three counting the finish to Blade.  The Wall of the Goddess faces west and features several short (but good) routes.  Finally the Southwest Buttress has just two routes on very good rock.  All this should probably be listed under Avalon.  I laid it out here to clarify the extent of the routes on the Northeast Face.

Looking at pictures now it looks like you can access this area by going to the third tier on the better trail up the right side (passing Wall of the Dead), and crossing the ledge system below the third tier.  We didn\'t print out the MP info for the area before going (it wasn\'t the original destination), so we were ""using the force"".  We ended up doing Thus Us and War Horse.  The base of these routes is a tough place to hang out.  It is a highly vegetated (stinging nettles), steep, loose hillside.

RE: CP ~ no it is not the southeast arete, it is the northeast one as stated. Perhaps it is ~V4, but only if you start on the holds head high. It could have been done before, but the lack of any evidence makes me wonder. Besides, the photo could be old.  I do agree, however, that beyond the few Eldo regulars, most people will not have a clue where this is. I'll have to think of how to give better directions.   RE: WC ~ the point of posting these problems was to let people know about them. I've wandered around many a woods because of some obscure photo or problem on MP or elsewhere. Sometimes I find what I am looking for, other times I don't. But currently, Eldo looks like it has very little to offer in the way of bouldering (at least on MP), and that just is not true.

Will did do Southpaw from a sds on the flake quite few years ago when the Blue Whale area was developed and the grade is just one group of climbers' opinion ... nothing is set in stone.

Although ECSP is not very big compared to many other state parks, a description of ""hike hike and more hiking will get you here"" for directions is totally useless.    All that being said, it would be great if there were more boulder problem descriptions for this area of the park, and you are correct in that there are few descriptions on MP.com.

That is obvious. However, as I said above, and will say again, this is my first entry on MP. As such, I am unfamiliar with the ""backend"" database side. I don\'t want the boulder to show up under West Ridge, or some other section. Do I enter it as a route, a new area, etc. The site is not set up very well for individual boulders. Therefore, I put in ""dummy"" text to see how it would show up on the site. I hope this makes sense.... So of course the entry needs to be fixed.... The vagueness was not directed as much in how to get there, as I know exactly how to (and have since the mid-\'90s) get there.  I\'ll work on the description.  RE: CP ~ I agree, taking a couple extra minutes to ""do it right"" is the proper thing to do. Please see above concerning the vagueness associated with the description.   I never said Will didn\'t do Southpaw. What I said was that this is not the southeast arete (which is a project and more in the V12 range), but the northeast one. There is no flake, nor has there ever been. The SDS begins on bad slopers, which is the crux.  Perhaps you are under the impression that I just found and did this problem/boulder. That is incorrect.

I can't find info about it in Rossiter's (or old Ament's) guidebooks, or on this site.  It felt 10-ish to me.  There was a little bit of chalk in the dihedral, so it's definitely seen some ascents.
