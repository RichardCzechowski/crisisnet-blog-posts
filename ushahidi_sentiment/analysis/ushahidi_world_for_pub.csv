Details of the intelligence-sharing agreement are laid out in a memorandum of understanding between the NSA and its Israeli counterpart that shows the US government handed over intercepted communications likely to contain phone calls and emails of American citizens. The agreement places no legally binding limits on the use of the data by the Israelis.

source: NSA shares raw intelligence including Americans' data with Israel • The Guardian
Some foreign (and domestic —Ed.) observers regard any U.S. surveillance efforts with suspicion, fearing that intelligence products will be used against their national interests, the privacy rights of their citizens, or to advance the interests of U.S. firms in competition for international business. This view is held even though it is well-known that many countries have long undertaken similar efforts. Nonetheless, some argue that electronic surveillance, except in a narrow, court-approved, law enforcement context, should not be undertaken by democratic governments.

2014-05-09 19:29:20.747879,"The historic low-level nuclear waste sites in both Port Granby and Welcome, Ontario are directly related to the nuclear activities that occurred in Port Hope. At both of these locations, Eldorado Nuclear (now Cameco) started dumping radioactive waste created by the Port Hope refinery during the 1950’s. The disposal of nuclear waste continued until the 1980’s and was largely unmonitored.  

Not unlike Port Hope, Port Granby has portions of its communities built on top of contaminated soil. Neither Cameco nor the Canadian government has ever revealed the full range of radioactive materials stored at Port Granby, so the true extent of the contamination remains unknown. The main concern with the presence of nuclear waste in Port Granby is that the community is located on the banks of Lake Ontario. Since the site is largely unmonitored and poorly contained, the leachate from the site runs directly into the lake. 

The radioactive waste site in Welcome, Ontario serves as a storage facility that has been (for the most part) a monitored waste site. However, there have been reports that cattle and people have been affected by the presence of radioactive waste on the site. Radioactive, chemical and heavy metal contaminants leach out of the waste piles and run untreated into the creeks. Many cattle in the area have died unexpectedly. Three members of the Austin family (who lived near the site) died from leukemia which doctors considered a very rare medical anomaly.  

Both the Port Granby and Welcome sites are part of the Port Hope Area Initiative (PHAI), which is involved in clearing contaminated soil and low-level contamination sites in the Port Hope Area. About a quarter of a million tons of contaminated soil is to be replaced in Port Hope, and roughly 450,000 cubic tons are to be excavated from Port Granby. Although the contaminated soil is being removed, there is no guarantee that the replacement soil will not become re-contaminated, or that the process will not release harmful gasses that are currently trapped in the contaminated soil. Such a cleanup can also disperse toxic thorium gas, radon gas and radium particles into the air; all three of these contaminants are highly toxic.  

The nuclear site in Welcome will not be undergoing the same sort of decontamination process as Port Granby. As of March 2010, Welcome has been the designated location for storing low level radioactive waste coming from both Port Hope and Port Granby. However, there have been no plans to improve the Welcome site in order to store new radioactive waste without the risk of re-contaminating waterways that lead into the great lakes.

Ontario Clean Air Alliance (OCAA) aims to move Ontario to a 100% renewable electricity grid by 2030. This would mean replacing our 3 nuclear stations, which sit on the shores of Lake Huron and Lake Ontario, with green energy. We can’t afford a Fukushima on one of our Great Lakes. To avoid the Pickering extension and Darlington rebuild projects, we could invest in lower cost conservation and water power imports from Quebec. And then the Bruce rebuild could be replaced with a suite of green energy options including conservation, water, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, biogas etc.",2014-05-04T05:33:30.261726,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Manitoulin', 'adminArea5': 'Tehkummah', 'postalCode': 'P0P', 'formattedAddress': 'Tehkummah, ON, Canada'}, 'coords': [-82.068359, 45.669875]}",oToXhi0bRJ-NeLnRIzqF_Q,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2014-02-04T14:05:00.000Z,36776-166,ushahidi,Port Granby and Welcome Waste Sites,"[{'name': 'Nuclear Hotspots', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:29:20.747879,Canada,ON,Manitoulin,Tehkummah,"Tehkummah, ON, Canada",P0P,,"{'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Manitoulin', 'adminArea5': 'Tehkummah', 'postalCode': 'P0P', 'formattedAddress': 'Tehkummah, ON, Canada'}","[-82.068359, 45.669875]",45.669875,-82.068359,Nuclear Hotspots,,,en

2014-05-09 19:29:22.089629,"The Blind River Uranium Refinery in Ontario, owned by Cameco, is the world’s largest facility that processes uranium ore into uranium trioxide (UO3). Mined deposits arrive at Blind River from ventures across Canada, Australia and the United States.  

Cameco also owns and operates the Port Hope Refinery. The company is a worldwide supplier of nuclear fuel (producing about 20% of the world’s nuclear fuel) with the Blind River facility churning out 24,000 tons of UO3 annually; originally 18,000 tons/year until the facility was granted a ten-year license extension as well as an increase in production quotas this past February, 2012. 

In 2012, the Blind River facility was granted a ten-year license extension as well as an increase in production quotas. That same year, June 2012, the facility also experienced a contamination incident where three workers were exposed to airborne uranium dust. The exposure occurred when a worker loosened the ring clamp on a 208 liter drum of uranium oxide yellowcake from Uranium One’s Willow Creek Facility in Wyoming. The lid blew off the drum releasing 26 kilograms of uranium dust into the air. The three workers closest to the incident were not wearing proper respirators and are likely to experience the toxic long-term effects of uranium exposure. 

This is not the only exposure incident that has occurred at the Blind River facility. Reports published by Northwatch and the Serpent River First Nation, the two most prominent NGO authorities commenting on the actions of the refinery, have documented an ‘accidental’ emission of 178 kilograms of uranium dust into the atmosphere in May, 1990. The 1990 leakage is similar to the June, 2012 incident but occurred on a much larger scale. The effects of the 1990 spill, as well as the continued presence of the refinery, are found in the elevated uranium levels in soil samples collected by the NGOs in the area. Northwatch has also noted that the overall uranium emissions from the Blind River Facility have remained in the 12-15 kilogram/year range over the last several years. Airborne uranium can remain in the lungs, or it can enter the bloodstream, kidneys, and/or bones, causing damage to these organ systems. 

The exploitation of the Elliot Lake Basin by nuclear energy producers has not only affected the health of the environment and the people that live in the area, but has also ruined the territory of the Canadian First Nations that live there.  The location is the summer home of the Ojibway Nation, in the northern area of the basin. Closer to the Blind River facility, the Serpent River First Nations have been battling against the presence of nuclear companies. The Serpent River people have worked closely with Northwatch to develop research on the effects of the nuclear refinery. First Nations residing in environmentally impacted areas often feel the negative and toxic effects before most other Canadian citizens, as they are pushed to the borders of communities. The release of radioactive toxins in the Elliot Lake basin, both from the airborne uranium emitted by the Blind River refinery and by the tailings in Elliot Lake basin, is resulting in grave health problems in these communities.

Ontario Clean Air Alliance (OCAA) aims to move Ontario to a 100% renewable electricity grid by 2030. This would mean replacing our 3 nuclear stations, which sit on the shores of Lake Huron and Lake Ontario, with green energy. We can’t afford a Fukushima on one of our Great Lakes.

2014-05-09 19:30:33.983685,"In what may be an unprecedented move, 23 Texans who host wind turbines on their property have filed suit against two different wind farm developers, claiming that companies “carelessly and negligently failed to adequately disclose the true nature and effects that the wind turbines would have on the community, including the plaintiffs’ homes.”

The plaintiffs host hundreds of turbines on projects developed by Duke Energy and E.ON, and as a Duke spokesman noted, they did consent to the placement of the turbines.  However, the lawsuit stresses that the companies told residents the turbines “would not be noisy, would not adversely impact neighboring houses and there would not be any potential health risk.”  

This court challenge stands apart from most previous nuisance suits, nearly all of which been filed by non-participating neighbors of wind farms (ie, local residents who are not hosting turbines themselves).  Most annoyance surveys suggest that wind farm hosts are less likely to be bothered by turbine noise than non-participating neighbors, and many wind projects make an effort to spread the financial benefits to include some non-host neighbors, because of suggestions that broader project participation will increase community acceptance.  In this case, however, the plaintiffs are receiving lease payments and tax benefits that will exceed $50 million over the life of the projects.

Among the plaintiffs are Willacy County Commissioner Noe Loya, who is said to “no longer enjoy sitting outside because of the loud noise,” with turbine noise inside and outside his home “disturbing the peace and making it difficult to enjoy living there.”  Another plaintiff, a local Justice of the Peace, “has difficulty sleeping, cannot have his windows open (and) cannot enjoy the sound of nature, due to loud noise from wind turbines.”  The lawsuit also claims that some residents have abandoned their homes. In addition to noise issues, the suit includes visual impact, property value, and health effects claims.

E.ON spokesman Elon Hasson, says the company is reviewing the suit. “We develop all of our wind farms in a safe, state-of-the-art and responsible manner. . . We believe these claims will be shown to have no validity.” 
UPDATE, 1/31/14: Spokesmen from both companies issued statements noting that one claim of the suit—that the companies had no plans to remove the turbines at the end of their useful life—is false, and stressed their ongoing monitoring and maintenance of the machines.  They more generally dismissed the other accusations, as well. 

The suit was filed in State District Court in November.  In December, the companies requested that it be moved to federal court, where U.S. District Judge Hilda Tagle has called for a response from the companies by February 6.",2014-05-04T05:47:21.524056,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'TX', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Willacy Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Raymondville', 'postalCode': '78580', 'formattedAddress': '78580, TX'}, 'coords': [-97.698227, 26.494822]}",ZncGQf-AQ36bMTVpV47Zeg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2014-01-31T14:20:00.000Z,42825-678,ushahidi,23 Texas Farmers having noise problems,"[{'name': 'Audible', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Social disruption', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Wind Developer', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:30:33.983685,United States,TX,Willacy Co.,Raymondville,"78580, TX",78580,,"{'adminArea3': 'TX', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Willacy Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Raymondville', 'postalCode': '78580', 'formattedAddress': '78580, TX'}","[-97.698227, 26.494822]",26.494822,-97.698227,Audible,Social disruption,Wind Developer,en
2014-05-09 19:30:34.827833,"I can attest to the noise disturbance inside and outside of my home, as I live just mere feet of the setback radius ordinance, for non-participating occupants at the Twin Ridges Wind Farm operated by Everpower, located in Southern Somerset County, PA. Please stress to our local Somerset County Commissioners that these are definitely a nuisance for communities who house the turbines. In our quest for resolve, a year ago at start up, we were told by Everpower officials that they had a manufactures guarantee that the turbines sound no louder than a refrigerator and that is totally false. I don’t know what part of the turbine that guarantee refers to but not the overall noise that is created by these things. Our township also developed an agreement with the recommendations from Everpower for a 50 decibel limit on noise. It was not explained in layman’s terms to the officials accepting the agreement that the 50 decibels was not overall noise heard, it was just the noise that the turbines created. A noise study was performed at our home May-June 2013 and was determined to be below 50 decibels after all background noise was filtered out fro the turbine noise. I might add that I know by way of what is heard from these things that a 50 decibels noise limit is not low enough or acceptable in our situation. When I purchased my land of approx. 200 acres it was for my love of being in the outdoors and the serenity of the surroundings. At that time Everpower was already working on permitting in for this area which was unbeknown to me. I built my home with my own hands taking approx. 5 yrs to complete. Then the turbines were erected and the value of something that took my entire life to work for has now been de-valued. No one in there right mind would want to purchase this property if I decide to flee. They could not stand to have the sounds. I cannot go outside and enjoy the outdoors at all. Everpower proposed to me sound board for my home, added insulation, new windows and blinds to cover the flickering effects when the sun hits the turbines at different times of the year. They did not know how to comment when asked “what do I do in the summer when I want to have my windows open”. I too feel as though the landowners in our immediate area were not fully disclosed with the effects that the outlying community would have to suffer. It is a shame that our tax dollars that subsidize these projects are creating such disarray within communities. The last communication with Everpower was the results of the noise study performed at our home in May-June of 2013. The letter states: The test results demonstrate that the sound level attributable to the Project remains below the 50dBa range. While such levels are relatively low-in fact, quite similar to the background levels measured throughout the survey at remote locations miles away from any turbines-compliance with the permit condition does not automatically imply that the Project in inaudiable. In this case, the house, which is constructed of logs, has exterior walls that are heavier and more massive than normal and has few and relatively small windows on the side of the house facing the project. What this generally means is that the house is already unusually well-suited to resist intrusion from outside sounds. The situation is that there is no practical way of adding additional mass to the walls or roof or sealing every crack, nor would there be any significant benefit from improving the acoustical performance of the windows with storm windows because the glazed area is small enough relative to the overall façade area that the change would not, in all likelihood, be noticeable. A practical solution may be to use a white noise generator inside the McKenzie house, such as a Marpac Dohm-DS “sound conditioner”, which, because any noise from the Project must be quite low in magnitude, may be able to provide some effective masking. Also, I am not sure if Texas receives much icing conditions, but if you think that these things are loud on normal days you should hear them when they ice up.

2014-05-09 19:30:35.014890,"It is supposed to thrive in blustery conditions. But this 115ft wind turbine crashed to the ground after being forced over in high winds.

The £250,000 tower was left a ‘mangled, blackened wreck with melted blades’, say witnesses, after apparently struggling to stand up to 50mph gusts.

Experts believe the winds were so strong the blades span out of control causing the massive structure to catch fire and collapse. It was supposed to have a life expectancy of 25 years – but has lasted just three.

2014-05-09 19:33:01.770394,"Khulani Development Organisation was formed on 3rd September 2013 due to the increase of drug related incidents in our schools, as well as the lack of suitable Life Orientation and Skills Identification being offered to our learners in the rural and urban schools which results in a high dropout rate.

South African society and schools are experiencing a moral and social crisis. This is evident in the social ills that are experienced on a daily basis and also backed up by Crime Statistics. We need to change the values and mindsets of our children to become clear sighted and responsible for the choices they make and the Path of Discovery Process will go a long way to achieving this. The Substance Abuse Awareness Education section of the workshop leaves a very definite impression on the learners and also equips them with the knowledge to make informed decisions.


The program not only deals with Substance Abuse Awareness but builds up the participants’ self-esteem, and self-confidence, deals with renewal and motivation, discovery of unique natural skills and abilities, self-awareness of potential, appreciation of cultural diversity, career development and finding and growing their best selves, which empowers the learner to say NO to Drugs.

2014-05-09 19:28:29.002308,"On January 20, the online Syrian Observer reported the arrest and rape of a woman named Suad, 35. The story was attributed to the General Commission of the Syrian Revolution, a network of opposition groups.

The news source described how she had left her home in Marrat al-Numan, on the outskirts of Idlib, to check on her family in Karm al-Zaitoun. On arriving, however, she said that she found that her family had already left the house. Suad and her child were arrested on the way back to her town, at the Wadi ad-Dahab checkpoint, according to the report. She was charged with “being from a neighborhood which had rebelled against the regime” and spent five days at the checkpoint.

“They led me into a horrible room, then suddenly, a group of soldiers attacked me and began to bite me,” Suad said. “At the door, a man named Abu Naif stood. I later learned that he was the commander of the checkpoint. He supervised the torture and gave orders. His role in the tragedy was to put a knife to mine and my son’s throat, and threatened to kill us after the torture ended.”

She continued: “On the third day, the level of the cruelty doubled and the soldiers began to bite me more violently. Then they injected me with something that made me lose consciousness. But I was woken later by violent punches to the face and verbal, sectarian abuse against me and my child.”
 
The soldiers took turns raping her, she said. 

“They were filming everything with a camera, leaving me afterwards feeling half dead, amid the screams of my child,” she said. “They released me after five days, and I walked for hours until I reached a Free Syrian Army checkpoint. They took me to my husband’s house in Marrat al-Numan.”

At the end of the report, Suad was quoted as urging women who have been raped in Syria to speak out: “This will not hurt their dignity, rather it will guarantee their rights, and will make sure that the criminals will be punished,” she said.

The dates of the reported rapes are unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC's Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:24:00.799861,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea1': 'Syria', 'formattedAddress': 'Syria'}, 'coords': [36.633333, 35.933333]}",2H3E_J4XQ7OrAk4H8qX8UA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2014-01-21T19:10:00.000Z,34369-254,ushahidi,Woman describes multiple rapes at Idlib checkpoint,"[{'name': '3GF.

TurbinesGF2Eleven witnesses have explained how wind turbines have affected their lives while delivering testimony at the Environmental Review Tribunal (ERT). The hearings continue this week in Toronto and Demorestville.

The ERT is examining the decision to approve an industrial wind turbine project at Ostrander Point, Prince Edward County.
 During March and April, ERT members Heather Gibbs and Robert Wright heard many hours of expert testimony from dozens of Prince Edward County Field Naturalists’ (PECFN) case witnesses on how nine 500-foot turbines planted in concrete bases and with wing spans of a football field will impact plants and animals and the Important Bird Area on the shoreline of South Marysburgh.
 The wind development company experts countered that there will be harm but not so great as to be irreversible.

This month, the hearing changed its focus to how turbines risk human health in a case brought forward by the Alliance to Protect Prince Edward County (APPEC). Their appeal must prove serious harm to human health, though not necessarily irreversible harm.

The witnesses are current or former residents of the operating wind projects at Clear Creek, Kent-Breeze, Melancthon, Talbot, and Wolfe Island.

Most either were in favor of renewable energy, or were indifferent until wind turbines changed their lives.

The witnesses reported a variety of similar adverse symptoms – principally sleep disturbance, nausea, migraine, vertigo, cognitive impairment, high blood pressure, and cardiac events.  They also report suffering from profound stress brought on by deteriorating health, community and even family divisions, severe financial loss, and abandoned, unsalable homes.

“These victims are the coincidental casualties of wind power development,” says Henri Garand, APPEC Chairman. “Despite numerous complaints to developers, municipal governments, the Ministry of Environment and two Ontario premiers, nothing has been done to relieve their situations or even acknowledge the real problems.  The MOE not only has failed to enforce compliance with noise standards but has continued to approve wind power projects based on the same inadequate setback regulations.”

“The ongoing ERT appeal has now given legal recognition to the many abuses that have already occurred.  Starting May 27 in Toronto, expert medical witnesses Dr. Robert McMurtry and Dr. Sarah Laurie will confirm and explain adverse health effects caused by wind turbines.

“This proof of serious harm to human health meets the requirements of the ERT in order to cancel the MOE’s approval of the Ostrander Point project,” said Garand. “It will also discredit the MOE’s regulatory process and standards for Renewable Energy Approvals.  Then rural Ontarians will be protected from the consequences of unsafe wind power development.”

The following APPEC reports on ERT Appeal on Ostrander Point Witnesses from May 9 – May 24, 2013 were written by Henri Garand and Paula Peel.

May 9th ERT Hearing on the Human Health Appeal
By H. Garand
 The first day of the Environmental Review Tribunal on the human health appeal consisted of the opening statement by APPEC lawyer Eric Gillespie, disputes over admissibility of evidence, and testimony of the first witness.
APPEC Opening Statement: Eric Gillespie explained that the present appeal will build on a 2011 ERT decision. In the Erickson appeal in Chatham-Kent the ERT, after hearing from 25 expert witnesses, concluded the following:
 1. Sleep disturbance, headache, ear pressure, vertigo, visual blurring, tachycardia, irritability, and panic episodes can all be symptoms of exposure to wind turbines.
 2. The symptoms indicate “extreme annoyance” and are “serious” effects.
 3. It is not necessary to demonstrate the mechanism causing the effects, whether noise, low-frequency sound, or infrasound.
 4. Wind turbines can cause adverse effects “if placed too close to people. The debate has now evolved to one of degree.”
Consequently, APPEC will call 17 witnesses. Eleven of these live near the Melancthon I and II, Kruger, Clear Creek, Talbot, Wolfe Island, and Kent Breeze wind projects. They have two elements in common: similar health issues and residence within two km of a wind turbine.
 Three witnesses live near the proposed Ostrander Point project and have pre-existing conditions that make them susceptible to wind turbine exposure.
 Three expert witnesses will provide relevant background and opinion. Dr. Robert McMurtry and Robert Thorne, Ph.D. were qualified as medical witnesses in the Erickson appeal. Dr. Sarah Laurie has wide experience assessing patients living near wind projects.

In contrast, the Ministry of Environment (MOE) and Gilead Power are calling witnesses on acoustical engineering who will testify that the Ostrander Point project is the same as other projects in complying with the 550-m setback and 40-dbA noise level based on noise modelling irrespective of geography or demographics. APPEC will have little conflict with such evidence.
 Other expert witnesses for MOE and Gilead will revisit the issue of causation. But as the Ericskon appeal demonstrated, the debate is over. APPEC accepts the ERT finding that turbines located beyond 550 m cause “annoyance.”
Ministry of Environment Statement: Lawyer Sylvia Davis made no opening statement except to dispute APPEC’s interpretation of the Erickson ruling. She identified six witnesses: Denton Miller, MOE Approvals; Brian Howe, HGG Engineering; and Drs. David Colby, Cornelia Barnes and Kieran Moore.
Gilead Power Statement: Lawyer Bryn Gray made no opening statement. He identified six witnesses: Shant Dakouzian, Helimax noise assessments; Al Lightstone, acoustical engineer; G. Leventhall and Werner Richards, on low-frequency sound and infrasound; and Chris Olsson, Ph.D. and Dr. Robert McCunney, both on health studies.
Ministry of Environment Background Witness: Coreen Schofield, senior program coordinator, MOE Approvals and Access, displayed a series of maps identifying where APPEC witnesses live in proximity to wind turbines. She explained that “receptor” refers to a building, structure, or vacant land used in the determination of setbacks. She said that Noise Assessment Reports are based on computer models and that complaints are handled by the MOE’s compliance branch.

All parties had previously agreed that Ms. Schofield would provide exclusively background information on witness locations. Mr. Gillespie therefore objected when Ms. Davis introduced a document that cited municipal populations, the number of project participants who are receptors, and the number of receptors closer than APPEC’s witnesses to turbines. To enable the hearing to carry on, the ERT Panel ruled that all the exhibits (maps and explanatory documents) would be accepted for identification purposes, but the parties would make submissions later on relevance.
Medical Records: A new Gilead Power lawyer, Daryl Cruz, questioned the status of the medical records provided by APPEC witnesses. He argued that they should be accepted as business records of medical services but not as records giving medical opinions. Such opinions constituted hearsay unless doctors were called to confirm the truth of the opinions or diagnoses.
 Ms. Davis stated that medical records had also been submitted for witnesses’ family members. Witnesses could not testify on this hearsay evidence.
 Mr. Gillespie argued that the records had been sought by MOE and Gilead and that their provision was supposed to avoid the need to call doctors. Though witnesses might not be able to cite diagnoses, they could testify to their own experience and their direct observations of family members.

Co-chair Robert Wright said the ERT Panel would defer a decision on medical records in order to give time for submissions. In the interim it would accept witnesses’ testimony, barring hearsay, and would weight the evidence.
 Other Medical Information: Mr. Cruz questioned the admissibility of interrogatories (178-item questionnaires) and other forms completed by witnesses upon the request of MOE and Gilead. The ERT Panel directed all parties to discuss the problem. An agreement was reached to treat the interrogatories as preparatory material but to accept the forms as equivalent to witness statements and admit them as evidence subject to removal of hearsay.

Testimony of Monica Elmes
 Monica Elmes, the first of APPEC’s witnesses, described the experience of living near the 20 wind turbines visible from her home. Her family had been approached about participating in the wind project, but research led to her questioning the impacts. As a result she has been ostracized by participating neighbours. She is presently the spokesperson for the Chatham-Kent Wind Action Group.

Though Ms. Elmes had expected protection from regulatory setbacks, the noise level was obvious when the turbines started operating. The noise affects enjoyment of her property and sound levels inside her house during the summer. Audible noise disrupts sleep in a house that relies on open windows for cooling.
 Her own sleep is not affected during the winter, but her husband suffers from continuing sleep disturbance and has also had attacks of vertigo. He finds relief by sleeping away from home or in the unfinished basement, which requires his shutting down the furnace and thereby cutting off heat to the house.

Ms. Elmes also spoke about the overall impact on the quality of her life. She said she is distressed when some neighbours call late at night complaining to her about the turbines. On the other hand, friends from outside the area now decline to visit.
 Before wind turbine operation Ms. Elmes said the ambient night-time noise levels in her house measured 25-27 dbA. Now the level is in the 40’s to low 50’s. So far she has made 180 complaints to the MOE’s “spills line” about the lack of compliance. MOE field officers came several times but not when the noise was as loud, and they brought no equipment to measure it. However, they advised her to keep filing complaints. She also asked for the wind company’s noise protocol and abatement policies, but she was told these would only be available through a Freedom of Information Act request.

Report on May 14th ERT Hearing on Health Appeal
By Paula Peel
 The Environmental Review Tribunal heard the continuing testimony of Monica Elmes and the full testimony of Mike Davey, both APPEC witnesses.
Examination of Monica Elmes (contd.)
 APPEC Lawyer Eric Gillespie asked about pre-existing medical conditions in the Elmes family. Ms. Elmes said her health, as well as her husband’s and 11-year-old son’s, was excellent before the Talbot wind project began operations. Since then her husband Neil has suffered from sleep disturbance, fatigue, and vertigo leading to lower work productivity, less enjoyment of life, and less tolerance for stress at home and work. Her son’s asthma has returned after a four-year absence. The medical advice her family has received is to consider relocation and to take medication for high blood pressure and vertigo.
 The Ministry of Environment (MOE) has responded to Ms. Elmes’ complaints by sending field officers without equipment for measuring compliance with noise limits, by scheduling visits during business hours despite reported night-time noise, and by advising her to continue to file complaints.
 Ms. Elmes said she is aware of 22 other project residents who have also complained to MOE in spite of living outside 40-dbA noise-modeled contour lines. Some have sought relief by installing air conditioning, buying waterfalls that emit white noise, sleeping in their basements, or even abandoning their homes.


Cross-Examination of Ms. Elmes
 Gilead Power Lawyer Bryn Gray confirmed that Ms. Elmes lives 1,776 m from the closest wind turbine, within 2 km of two other turbines, and within 2.5 km of two more. She dislikes the views from a house with turbines on three sides. As spokesperson for the Chatham-Kent Wind Action Group, Ms. Elmes has written on the harmful effects of wind development on wildlife, property values, and rural character. She believes that wind projects are a waste of taxpayer and ratepayer money, wind turbines are inefficient generators of electricity, and wind development is a scam. She feels it is “criminal for the government to proceed with development in light of health effects.”
MOE lawyer Sylvia Davis confirmed that Ms. Elmes has not been given a written diagnosis that her own and her family’s symptoms are caused by wind turbines.


Re-examination of Ms. Elmes
 Eric Gillespie asked Ms. Elmes why she has a record of only one medical appointment. She said she seldom sought medical care even for injuries like her current poison ivy rash and broken toe.

Examination of Mike Davey
 Prior to wind project construction Mr. Davey had lost a kidney to cancer surgery, displayed diabetic symptoms, and developed chronic kidney disease from high blood pressure. But he was in recovery until two wind projects were constructed and started operating in 2009 and 2010. His health problems now consist of sleep disturbance, high blood pressure, tinnitus, memory and concentration loss, chest pressure and palpitations, muscle and bone pain, and recurrence of diabetes. Besides medication he seeks relief by sleeping in the basement, in his car, or outside, including on one occasion a ditch.

An August 2012 MOE study of noise at Mr. Davey’s home found an average sound of 44.3 dbA, though much higher levels were recorded between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. It concluded that the wind turbines are in compliance if other noises are factored out, but it recommended a follow-up study. Nine months later, no such study has taken place.
 Mr. Davey has sought medical attention but has found doctors unwilling to acknowledge a connection between his symptoms and wind turbines. A sleep centre diagnosed sleep apnea, though he had not suffered from it while bedridden and recovering from cancer surgery. He was twice denied a cortisol test, a screening procedure that will be used in Health Canada’s study of wind turbine health effects.
 Mr. Davey is not a member of the Chatham-Kent Wind Action Group and has not written letters opposing wind development.
 Cross-examination of Mr. Davey

Gilead Power lawyer Darrel Cruz led Mr. Davey through a long list of the medical procedures and medications he has received. Mr. Cruz pointed to discrepancies between the records and Mr. Davey’s statements, and suggested that Mr. Davey’s diabetes is related to his weight, chest pains are due to reduced blood flow to his heart, and muscle and bone pain are caused by osteoarthritis. Other conditions were not confirmed by medical reports.
 MOE’s Ms. Davis asked why Mr. Davey had connected his symptoms with wind turbines. He said it was due to his own and a neighbour’s sleep disturbance after the turbines started. His subsequent research made him think that his other symptoms are related to low-frequency or infrasound.
 When asked how he generally feels about wind turbines, Mr. Davey said he likes their appearance but is concerned about the value of his property and its salability because of health effects.


Re-examination of Mr. Davey
 Mr. Gillespie confirmed that Mr. Davey lives 747 m from a wind turbine in the Talbot wind project (2010) and is 2.4 km away from the Boralex project (2009). He reviewed Mr. Davey’s medical history with respect to the start up of each project and established the coincidental chronology.

Report on May 15th ERT Hearing on Health Appeal
By H. Garand
 The Environmental Review Tribunal heard the testimony of Lisa Michaud, whose family resides near the Kent-Breeze wind project, the subject of the 2011 Chatham-Kent ERT appeal.


Examination of Lisa Michaud
 The Michaud family’s self-built home is known as receptor 210 of the Kent-Breeze project, which was constructed and began operation while an ERT appeal was taking place.
 The Michauds had little prior knowledge of the project. They first learned of it in a notice addressed to “Occupant” just before the developer’s final public meeting in September or October 2009. They attended the meeting and asked questions, but left with mixed feelings and no information on harmful effects. They did not know of the ERT appeal until the decision was released in July 2011.
 Ms. Michaud has a number of pre-existing medical conditions: fibromyalgia, high blood pressure, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and back pain. Her husband has also suffered from high blood pressure and back pain, and her son has seasonal allergies.
 Since wind turbines started operating in May 2011 she has experienced severe vertigo, sleep disturbance and breathing problems due to sound and vibrations, popping and buzzing in her ears, and distress due the effects on her family and home life. Both her husband and son have also been ill with vertigo, including vomiting. All these symptoms either are reduced or disappear when the family is away from home.

Family members have received medical attention for specific symptoms like vertigo. However, treatment has been complicated by their family doctor’s loss of license, substitute use of hospital emergency services, and finally, a new family doctor’s refusal to discuss wind-turbine effects or to provide related treatment after the family had launched a lawsuit.
 Initially, Ms. Michaud contacted wind developer Suncor and the Ministry of Environment (MOE). Complaints to the MOE resulted in only one field officer’s visit, without any testing for compliance. Later, the Michauds were informed that the personal information they had provided had been stolen from an MOE vehicle. The Michauds eventually approached every level of government, including the Ontario ombudsman. Ms. Michaud also used social media like FaceBook to present her concerns. When no one gave any real assistance, the Michaud family filed a $1.5 million lawsuit against Suncor.

Cross-Examination of Ms. Michaud
 MOE lawyer Sylva Davis reviewed Ms. Michaud’s medical history, focusing on her pre-existing conditions and treatments. She asked whether Ms. Michaud was aware that some medications could have the side effects of headache, dizziness, nausea, and muscle and bone pain. She also asked whether Ms. Michaud had sought therapy, such as that received for PTSD. Ms. Michaud replied that she has lived with stress all her life and has not sought therapy for it. The PTSD -related therapy was specific to a single problem. She added that the symptoms she has experienced since the turbines began operation are different from the symptoms associated with her pre-existing conditions.
 Ms. Davis explored Ms. Michaud’s feelings about wind development and was told that the Michaud family feels “abandoned by government” because they were not consulted at the outset, or even contacted personally by the developer, and had no say in the approval process, yet they are exposed to the risks. Ms. Michaud used to regard home as an “oasis from the stress of the world”; now it is “not a safe place.” Although only one wind turbine is visible from her house when leaves are off the intervening trees, she feels “nauseated and annoyed” when seeing wind projects in the area.
 Gilead Power lawyer Bryn Gray confirmed that the Michauds live 1,110 m from the nearest turbine and that audible noise is worst when the house is downwind. He asked why medical records are incomplete and was told that either the records are not readily available or the family cannot afford to obtain them.

Re-examination of Ms. Michaud
 APPEC lawyer Eric Gillespie asked Ms. Michaud about the train traffic on a rail line 200 m from her house. She said the number of trains has not changed since the family moved to the property in 2005, and train noise does not disturb them. When asked to compare her new symptoms with those from pre-existing conditions, she said the new symptoms are experienced only in the house or elsewhere around wind turbines, and they started with turbine operation and have never left.

APPEC Report on May 16th ERT Hearing on Health Appeal
By Paula Peel
 The Environmental Review Tribunal heard the testimony of Helen Fraser, who used to live near the Melancthon project, and of a pre-turbine witness, County resident Dr. Karen Hatchard.

Examination of Helen Fraser
 Mrs. Fraser identified receptor #134 on the Ministry of the Environment map as her former home of 31 years. She confirmed that turbines are located to the west, north and south in a “C” pattern, with the closest 423 m away.
 Both Mrs. Fraser and her husband had pre-existing medical conditions. However, their symptoms noticeably increased after the project started up. Mrs. Fraser’s fibromyalgia worsened as did her chronic fatigue. She felt a constant tickling in her ear as though something were crawling around inside. A “strobing,” or flicker, effect coming into the home caused nausea and debilitating headaches. On calm nights, Mrs. Fraser could feel her heart beating to the pulse of the blades.
 Mrs. Fraser noted that the turbines rotated according to wind direction and that the pain was at its worst when they displayed a side profile. They made a “horn” sort of noise and a popping sound that was disruptive.

Initially the Frasers had no idea why they were feeling so unwell. However, they began to notice that their symptoms disappeared whenever they left home, and returned when they came back. In 2006, on a trip to the east coast, they were symptom-free for 25 days. Within 24 hours of returning home the symptoms recurred.
 Ms. Fraser described leading a normal life in the country until the turbines started up. Then their social life was dramatically altered. Noise made it impossible to use the deck outside. People asked how they could live with the noise. Mr. Fraser moved into a basement room without windows so he could get sleep.
 A year or so after the project became operational the Frasers accepted a buy-out from Canadian Hydro, the project developer. They left their home in 2007. Mrs. Fraser said they never would have left otherwise—they were forced out of their home. Their choice was staying and being ill or moving and getting their health back. Moving away from the turbines was really their only course of action.

Cross-Examination of Helen Fraser
 Sam Rogers, yet another lawyer for Gilead, spent a tedious few hours reviewing Mrs. Fraser’s medical records from 2001 to the present time. His questioning confirmed that Mrs. Fraser’s chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia dated from 1990. More than once, Mrs. Fraser said that symptoms were more severe when she lived near wind turbines.
 Sylvia Davis, lawyer for the Ministry of the Environment, noted that Mrs. Fraser could see only a few turbines from her house. Mrs. Fraser said that she could not avoid looking at them because they were so close.

Re-examination of Mrs. Fraser
 Mr. Gillespie asked Mrs. Fraser about two people on her road and seven others in the area who have moved away. She also knows other people struggling with conditions from turbines who cannot afford to move.

Examination of Dr. Karen Hatchard
 Dr. Hatchard, a chiropractor, said that because of her interest in health she began reading on the subject of turbines. She learned that people with motion sensitivity and vertigo seem to be affected more. Dr. Hatchard has been prone to vertigo since youth. When she visited Wolfe Island, flickering caused a vertigo effect and made her feel light-headed. She is concerned for her well-being and about her ability to continue working to support herself and her family.
 Dr. Hatchard confirmed that she lives in the vicinity of Ostrander Point and she often walks near there.


Cross-Examination of Dr. Hatchard
 Gilead lawyer Bryn Gray asked why concerns noted on Dr. Hatchard’s witness information form were not raised during her annual physical examination. Dr. Hatchard said she has learned to manage her health. She disagreed with Mr. Gray that hearing sensitivity and vertigo are two different things. She said that if her hearing is affected this can cause a vertigo attack.
Report on May 17th ERT Hearing on Health Appeal
By H. Garand
 The Environmental Review Tribunal heard the testimony of Nicole Horton, whose family resides near the Kruger wind project. The hearing concluded with arguments on the admissibility of medical records as evidence.
 Examination of Nicole Horton
 Nicole Horton and her family live between the Kruger and Invenergy wind power projects in Chatham-Kent. The two nearest wind turbines are 700 m southwest of the house. Depending on the direction Ms. Horton looks, 8-24 turbines are visible during the day; 120 red warning lights are visible at night on the approach to the house.
 When the Kruger project started up in fall 2008, it caused noticeable vibrations in the walls of the Hortons’ house. Ms. Horton and her husband spent $80,000 on renovations (insulation, rounded siding, steel roof, and new windows) which have diminished but not eradicated the vibrations.
 Noise has also been a problem. It is worst when the leaves are off the trees in the forest around their house. Kruger Energy paid for an acoustic study but did not release the complete report to the Hortons. They did receive a summary, however, that showed spikes of sound above 60 dbA. Kruger suggested Ontario Hydro equipment was responsible, but Hydro did not find any problems during a week’s testing.
 Ms. Horton’s pre-existing conditions relate to PMS. She described herself as a “regular healthy person” before the wind project. Her family had no previous health problems.
 When the turbines started, the whole family experienced acute nausea. Since then Ms. Horton has suffered from headaches, heart palpitations, internal body vibrations, fatigue, loss of concentration and memory, swollen and dry eyes, and body rashes that left permanent scaring. Her husband has had sleeplessness and periods of moodiness. Her two children have complained of headaches, back and joint pain, swollen eyes, and nausea.
 The Hortons’ custom-built “dream home” is now a “nightmare.” Ms. Horton feels like “her old self again” when she is away for just a few days. This is true not only when she is on vacations but even when she has traveled to Alberta for a parent’s surgery and for a funeral. Her husband, a fireman, feels better when sleeping on long shifts at the fire hall.
 The family doctor was at first skeptical of wind turbines as the overall cause but has not found any other explanations. Diagnoses have ranged from allergies to thyroid problems to mood disorder. Medical treatment has relieved specific symptoms. Counselling has provided no relief. She has been advised to renovate her home and/or relocate.
 The Hortons are trying to sell their house but insist on full disclosure of the problems to every potential buyer. They have also filed a lawsuit against Kruger Energy.

Ironically, Ms. Horton liked the turbines when first installed and even took photos showing the family home with turbines nearby. Now she is depressed that no one in the Ministry of Environment or Kruger has done anything about the reported health problems. Some days she would just like to walk away from the whole situation.


Cross-examination
 Ms. Horton’s cross-examination will occur on a later date.


Medical Records Dispute
 The admissibility of medical records, which the ERT panel had left unsettled on May 9, was addressed in formal submissions at the end of the hearing. The outcome of the dispute may have a considerable bearing on the ERT process because it could lead to more witnesses and more days of testimony.
 Gilead lawyer Darrel Cruz elaborated on the arguments made earlier. The Evidence Act, said Mr. Cruz, distinguishes between business and technical records: the former are documents produced in the daily course of business; the latter deal with technical matters and opinions, and include medical records. Mr. Cruz said that Gilead is willing, however, to accept the medical records of APPEC’s witnesses as business records in as much as they identify dates of visits, prescriptions, etc. But Gilead is not willing to accept them as evidence stating the truth of the diagnoses or medical opinions expressed. Under the Evidence Act, a doctor or other expert must be called to verify the truth of opinions.
 MOE lawyer Sylvia Davis agreed with Gilead’s position. She said the ERT may admit hearsay evidence but should exercise the best evidence rules. Clinical notes are often unclear whether the words are quotations, paraphrases, or aids to memory. She added that even when medical records have been admitted without verification by physicians, the ERT has put such little weight on the evidence that it might as well have been excluded.
 APPEC lawyer Eric Gillespie pointed out that the issue was not raised in February when Gilead and the MOE had insisted that witnesses produce their medical records. By referring to the Evidence Act and citing civil court case law, Mr. Cruz was attempting to import civil law into an administrative law proceeding. There is no relevant case law for Ontario tribunals because they have routinely admitted medical records without qualification. Drawing the distinction Mr. Cruz has made would set a new precedent. Moreover, Mr. Cruz’s solution created a double standard. Gilead would be able to use the records as the basis for cross-examination, but APPEC would have to call physicians to prove the truth of the medical opinions recorded.
 Mr. Gillespie therefore left the panel with a clear choice: Either exclude all the medical records (as APPEC had argued in February) or admit them fully.
 The ERT panel conferred for half an hour then postponed a decision until May 21.

Report on May 21st ERT Hearing on Human Health Appeal
By H. Garand
 The Environmental Review Tribunal announced its ruling on medical records and heard the full testimony APPEC witness Douglas Desmond and the initial testimony of APPEC witness Stephana Johnston.


Decision on Medical Records
 Co-chair Robert Wright said there is no statutory bar to medical records in the Statutory Procedures Act. The ERT will admit the records as evidence but not for the truth of their contents under the Evidence Act. Therefore, if parties wish to rely on the medical opinions expressed, they should call the appropriate experts.


Examination of Douglas Desmond
 Douglas Desmond occupies Receptor No. 369 near the Talbot wind project in Chatham-Kent. He has lived in the house since 1978 on a farm owned by the Desmond family since 1795. Wind turbines surround the house, making it always downwind regardless of the wind’s direction. The closest turbine is at 1066 m, and ten others are within 1500 m.
 Shadow flicker was Mr. Desmond’s initial health concern. But the house is shaded by large trees, and shrubs have been left to grow and block the view from the windows. When the turbines started operation in late October 2010, Mr. Desmond was surprised to feel immediately the effect of sleep disruption. Later, he began to suffer migraines. He has also experienced shortness of breath, chest pain, and arrhythmia.
 Mr. Desmond, a sixty-three-year old lawyer, has no recent, relevant pre-existing medical conditions. He had a serious motor accident forty years ago, had migraines until his 30s, and has been treated for skin cancer during the last 20 years. The recent chest pain was initially diagnosed as due to reflux but has now led to a thyroid investigation.
 The family doctor prescribed drugs for sleep and migraines, but these have not been helpful and, in fact, caused disabling dizziness. Common non-prescription drugs have not worked either. Mr. Desmond has not seen a sleep specialist. His symptoms disappear when he is away from home for a few days or when the turbine blades are turning slowly or stopped.
 Mr. Desmond reported the noise problem numerous times to the Ministry of Environment (MOE) but received no effective response.


Cross-Examination of Mr. Desmond
 Gilead lawyer Bryn Gray asked Mr. Desmond about his concerns regarding property values. Mr. Desmond said he is concerned about all the economic impacts on Chatham-Kent, such as the industrialization of rural areas, reduction of agricultural land, and limitations on residential development. He had planned to sever part of his farm for new house construction but discontinued the process when wind development rendered the property unbuildable. He also said that wind turbines, irrespective of their appearance, are obstructions in a view and, like other obstructions, therefore affect the value and salability of properties with viewscapes.
 Though Mr. Desmond had challenged the Talbot project at the Ontario Municipal Board, it went ahead under the new regulations of the Green Energy Act.
 Mr. Desmond had also requested the MOE to conduct a full environmental assessment of Chatham-Kent before approving wind projects. He was concerned about the effect on waterfowl after speaking with Dr. Scott Petrie of Bird Studies Canada. Tundra swans formerly used Lake Erie and fields near his house for staging in spring and fall; now they avoid the area.
 In 2011 Mr. Desmond provided the Chatham-Kent Wind Action Group with a legal trust account for funds. He also spoke at a conference where he was self-identified as a “vocal opponent of large-scale industrial wind projects.”
MOE lawyer Sylvia Davis inquired further into Mr. Desmond’s medical records, noting diagnoses of osteoarthritis and bursitis for back and hip-and-thigh pain, respectively. Mr. Desmond said he accepted such pains as related to aging. The noise from turbines, however, is disturbing because of its variability, and he said his sleep disruption might be caused by low-frequency sound because the use of white noise does not bring any relief.


Examination of Stephana Johnston
 Stephana Johnston, an eighty-two-year-old former health educator, lives in her retirement home, Receptor No. 254 of the Clear Creek, Cultus-Frogmore wind projects in Norfolk County.
 Her symptoms started upon operation of the wind turbines in December 2008. She has felt pressure in her ears and head, sleep deprivation, fatigue in the morning, trembling in her abdomen, and dizziness that led to an injurious fall.
 Ms. Johnston’s pre-existing medical conditions have a long history. She was diagnosed with hypo-thyroid in 1980, diabetes in 1984, and intermittent high blood pressure in 2000.
 For the recent symptoms Ms. Johnston has received medical attention from her family doctor, an audiologist, and two neurologists, one of whom suggested she leave her home. She has declined to use sleep medication because of side effects. She has obtained periodic relief by sleeping in an apartment 40 km away and in a trailer on her son’s property, also distant from wind turbines.
 Her numerous complaints to the MOE have been without results. An agent did promise to measure turbine sound levels for compliance, but there has been no follow-up.
 The wind developer and two levels of government have been similarly unresponsive. Ms. Johnson explained the problems directly to Mike Crawley, then president of AIM PowerGen, but had no further contact. She presented a petition signed by 70 project residents to Norfolk council and had the local MPP table the same petition in the Ontario legislature.
 Ms. Johnston has tried to sell her house but has had no one come to view it. Recently, she filed a lawsuit against the owner of the wind project.

Report on May 22nd ERT Hearing on Human Health Appeal
By Paula Peel
 APPEC witness Stephana Johnston completed her testimony of the day before. The Environmental Review Tribunal heard the full testimony of APPEC witness Ed Kenney.


Examination of Stephana Johnston (cont’d)
 Ms. Johnston’s efforts to take care of her health have had some results. One doctor indicated that her problems since the turbines started up could be related to environmental exposure, and he recommended further study. In January this year a doctor with expertise in sleep apnea concluded that her sleep disturbance could not be attributed to apnea. After eliminating other possible causes the doctor noted similarities between Ms. Johnston’s symptoms and stories he has heard of disturbed sleep in others living in areas with wind turbines, and he suggested she leave the house permanently.


Cross-examination of Stephana Johnston
 Mr. Bryn Gray, lawyer for Gilead Power, asked about Ms. Johnston’s home in relation to the wind project. Ms. Johnston said her home is surrounded: Eight wind turbines are within 2 km; 18 within a 3-km radius of her home. In all, 25 turbines can be seen from her property if those from the Erie Shores Wind Farm 4 km away are included.
 Mr. Gray wanted to know why the first medical record specifically relating to wind farms was in June 2009 if Ms. Johnston’s problems began in December 2008. Ms. Johnston agreed that she did not inform her doctor about pressure in her head, ear problems and sleep problems during a January appointment. However, she did so in March 2009. The omission in the records does not mean it was not reported.
 Sylvia Davis, lawyer for the Ministry of the Environment (MOE), asked about the MOE’s 2010 acoustic-monitoring study. She noted that it was inconclusive and that the MOE was to return for more measurements. As far as Ms. Johnston knows, no one from MOE ever came back.


Re-examination of Stephana Johnston
 Mr. Wright, one of the panel co-chairs, asked Ms. Johnston what she meant by vibrations. Ms. Johnston said it is her understanding that some vibrations or sound patterns produced by wind turbines are audible and some are not. MOE’s monitoring equipment measures sound in the human audible range and is designed to filter out vibrations on the lower and top ends of the scale.
 Ms. Johnston was never asked by Gilead Power or the MOE if she would consent to be examined medically in preparation for the hearing.

Examination of Ed Kenney
 Mr. Kenney identified receptor 547 as his home on Wolfe Island. Since June 2009, when the turbines started up, he has suffered from ringing in the ears and disturbed sleep. Mr. Kenney noted the significant changes to what was once a tight-knit community. The wind project has created friction among friends, neighbours, and families. The property across the road from his house hosts three turbines. Mr. Kenney’s sister owns this property.
 On numerous occasions after the project started up, the Kenneys contacted the MOE about noise. They were told of the protocol to report problems to the company. As far as Mr. Kenney knows, the MOE never investigated any of their complaints.
 In early 2012 the MOE district office in Kingston told the Kenneys that the company planned to conduct sound tests on the closest turbines. The MOE wanted permission to erect equipment on the Kenney’s property in order to monitor the company’s results. The Kenneys did not give their permission. Mr. Kenney thought it doubtful that the MOE had the proper equipment to monitor noise.
 In 2008, the same year turbines were erected, the Kenney’s property value assessment increased by 79%. The Kenneys appealed the assessment in a very stressful hearing. The Kenneys are unhappy with the decision and have filed a motion requesting another hearing.
 Since the turbines came, Wolfe Island homes have been listed for sale for up to three or four years. Some homes have been taken off the market. Others sell for less than anticipated for well-kept waterfront homes. Mr. Kenney noted that their home was security for the future and there is stress in seeing lifesavings devalued and future plans no longer possible.
 Mr. Kenney has a pre-existing medical condition of Type 2 diabetes, but it is under control.

Cross-examination of Ed Kenney
 Bryn Gray asked about the proximity of wind turbines. Mr. Kenney said that 3 turbines are within a km, 14 turbines within 2 km, and 27 turbines within 3 km. Did Mr. Kenney not like the visual appearance? Mr. Kenney replied that the turbines did nothing to enhance his property.
 Mr. Gray noted the Kenney’s property assessment appeal cited such factors as industrial noise, industrial lighting, industrial traffic, health, viewshed, and degradation of the natural environment. If the tribunal had a finding of harm to health, it would be helpful to Mr. Kenney’s request for an OMB review hearing. Mr. Gray added that Mr. Kenney stands to gain financially.
 Sylvia Davis referred Mr. Kenney to the MOE’s 2012 offer to set up monitoring equipment. Mr. Kenney clarified that the MOE did not offer equipment in response to their complaints. To this day no one from the MOE has ever visited their property. The Kenneys have never been told the results of the company’s noise monitoring.

Re-examination of Ed Kenney
 Mr. Gillespie asked Mr. Kenney to explain his decisions, as raised during cross-examination, not to take sleep medication or to see a psychiatrist, psychologist or social worker. He said they could not tell him anything more than he already knew. As for noise, how could they change one’s mind on anything like that?
 Mr. Kenney was never asked by Gilead Power or the MOE if he would consent to be examined medically in preparation for the hearing.

Report on May 23rd ERT Hearing on Human Health Appeal
By H. Garand
 The Environmental Review Tribunal heard the testimony of APPEC witnesses Tracey Whitworth and Richard Copple.
Examination of Tracey Whitworth
 Tracey Whitworth used to live near the Clear Creek, Frogmore-Cultus wind projects, which began operation in November 2008. Wind turbines surround her house, Receptor 250. The closest turbine is 433 m away, a second nearby, and nine others within 2 km. Ms. Whitworth moved out of her house three years ago and has been unable to sell it.
 Ms. Whitworth rarely saw a doctor before the turbines started to operate. Then she experienced a broad range of symptoms: sleep disturbance; hearing impairment with aching, buzzing, and plugged ears; headaches; aches in wrists, knees and feet; twitching of face and limbs; chest pain; skin inflammations; blurred vision; dizziness; palpitations; high blood pressure; lethargy; nausea; diarrhea and uterine bleeding; anemia; and cognitive impairment. Many symptoms disappeared when she left home but recurred within an hour of her return. Other symptoms have lingered.
 To obtain relief, Ms. Whitworth, a high school teacher and department head, tried sleeping in her vehicle sometimes, remained at school after hours despite her fatigue, and spent weekends elsewhere. After a year and half, upon her son’s advice, she abandoned residence in her home.
 Ms. Whitworth’s conditions, such as chest pain, have not been explained by conventional medicine. An audiology exam detected no physical abnormalities. An MRI scan revealed white foci in her brain, but these disappeared a year after her move. A complete blood transfusion was recommended by one doctor, but the need for the procedure was disputed by another. Blood thinners were prescribed for a blood clot until a second MRI indicated a brain aneurysm. Two sleep studies found she suffered from a high number of arousals during sleep, but these are not related to sleep apnea. Since leaving her home she requires sleep medication no more than twice a month.
 However, one of Ms. Whitworth’s many doctors suggested that tissue damage has been caused by exposure to wind turbines. Dr. Nina Pierpont examined Ms. Whitworth in fall 2009 and diagnosed Wind Turbine Syndrome and vibro-acoustic disease.
 Ms. Whitworth is under psychiatric care but was advised by her psychiatrist not to disclose these medical records because of privacy issues and their irrelevance to wind turbines.
 Besides seeking medical care, Ms. Whitworth has complained to the developer and different government ministries. Once she met with Mike Crawley, president of AIM Power Gen (the project developer), but had no further contact. She repeatedly called the Ministry of Environment (MOE) but without results. She surveyed other project residents to learn of their similar reactions. She has given two newspaper interviews and spoken at a few public meetings so others will hear the news and get help.
 Recently, she filed a lawsuit again the project company.

Cross-Examination of Ms. Whitworth
 Gilead Power’s fourth lawyer, Eric Pellegrino, led Ms. Whitworth through her list of symptoms, questioning her medical records. He noted that the audiology report identified high-frequency hearing loss. There was no confirmation of bowel, cardiac, or neurological problems. Blood pressure tests did not register higher levels after wind turbines started up. She was treated for anxiety before the wind project was built. Anti-depressants have been prescribed, but their purpose cannot be determined without her psychiatric records.
 Ms. Whitworth responded that she did not report every condition to her family doctor on its first occurrence but rather as the effects developed. She said that doctors did not associate her symptoms at the time with wind turbines because she was living in just the second Ontario wind project.
 MOE Lawyer Sylvia Davis asked about Dr. Pierpont’s diagnosis. Ms. Whitworth said it is related to low-frequency sound. Dr. Sarah Laurie has also written several reply emails to her, but she does not regard either Dr. Pierpont or Dr. Laurie as treating physicians.


Re-examination of Ms. Whitworth
 APPEC Lawyer Eric Gillespie confirmed that neither Gilead Power nor the MOE has asked for Ms. Whitworth’s psychiatric records or a medical exam prior to testifying.

Examination of Richard Copple
 Richard Copple lives near Ostrander Point on a farm property with two historic barns. One barn serves as a residence for Mr. Copple and his wife, Dr. Karen Hatchard; the other is used for an import and repair business of luxury motor vehicles. Mr. Copple stressed that the repair work is very quiet: there are no impacts guns, hammering, or shouting.
 Mr. Copple’s health concerns are sleep disturbance for the family, his own tinnitus, and his wife’s susceptibility to vertigo.
 Although Mr. Copple’s education, training and experience are in mechanical and automotive engineering, he has been interested since childhood in noise reduction and filtering because his father rented lab space to Dr. Dolby of Dolby Systems. He said that the dbA scale used for measuring wind turbine noise is inappropriate because it does not give sufficient weight to low-frequency sound. The scale is therefore not suitable for recognizing effects on human health. He exhibited two charts showing the technical problems associated with turbine sounds.


Cross-examination of Richard Copple
 Bryn Gray asked if Mr. Copple had plans for moving. Mr. Copple said he liked the peace and quiet of his present location and would prefer to stay there. He confirmed that he has hearing loss in the high-frequency range. His concern about the project is with low-frequency sound.
 Mr. Copple also confirmed that his witness statement lists other concerns about the wind project: construction traffic and noise, and interference with emergency response service. The last is related to his volunteer work as a first responder.
 Sylvia Davis asked whether Mr. Copple is concerned about property values. He said his residence is modest and a commercial property would not likely be affected.

Report on May 24th ERT Hearing on Human Health Appeal
By Paula Peel
 APPEC witness Nicole Horton completed her testimony begun on May 17. The Environmental Review Tribunal heard the full testimony of APPEC’s final two post-turbine witnesses, Janet White and Roger Olivera.


Cross-examination of Nicole Horton
 Sylvia Davis, lawyer for the Ministry of the Environment (MOE), referred Ms. Horton to specific complaints in her medical records in the years before the Kruger Energy wind project commenced operations and to complaints since then. After the turbines started in fall 2008 Ms. Horton has suffered headaches, heart palpitations, internal body vibrations, fatigue, loss of concentration and memory, swollen and dry eyes, and body rashes that left permanent scarring.
 Ms. Davis noted that Ms. Horton’s second child, born in 2006, screamed for the first three months. If this child had been born in 2009, isn’t it fair to say that Ms. Horton would have blamed the wind turbines? Ms. Horton replied that the difference is that her son stopped screaming after three months. She criticized Ms. Davis for creating patterns where none exists.
 Bryn Gray, lawyer for Gilead Power, asked about Ms. Horton’s home in relation to the turbines. Ms. Horton said that turbines are on both sides of her home: Two are less than 700 m away and two others not much farther. There are also four turbines in each of the next two concessions over.
 Ms. Horton agreed with Mr. Gray that her doctor has never told her she has wind turbine syndrome. Mr. Gray asked Ms. Horton what her doctor has said. Ms. Horton noted a referral letter written by her doctor that makes reference to secondary vibration from wind turbine exposure. Ms. Horton told Mr. Gray that, as far as she can speak for her doctor, the doctor believes she is affected by the wind turbines.


Examination of Janet White
 Ms. White, a resident of Wolfe Island, spoke about her inability to sleep at night. Before the wind turbines started up Ms. White was a sound sleeper. Now she awakes every night between 1:30 a.m. and 3:30 a.m. and remains awake. Ms. White has not enjoyed her life on Wolfe Island since 2008 when the noise of the turbines began disturbing her own and her entire family’s sleep.
 Ms. White explained why she waited two years to make a complaint. She said that when other residents complained she saw no one was listening. But one day when she woke up, the windows of her home were rattling. She complained to the company. The reply she received months later from the company was full of inaccuracies and did nothing to remedy her complaint.


Cross-examination of Janet White
 Ms. Davis referred Ms. White to various complaints she has made during her annual physical examinations since the wind project started up, including fatigue, back pain and swelling in her hands. Ms. Davis noted that there is no mention in the medical records of wind turbines. Ms. White said that she literally “got the finger” once when she mentioned wind turbines to a doctor at the Queen’s Family Medical Centre in Kingston. She has not raised the subject with a doctor since.
 Ms. Davis referred Ms. White to an article called “Wrecking our Heaven” in the Kingston-Whig Standard, January 2012. Ms. White said she still believes that Wolfe Islanders are lab rats and no one cares about her children. She still believes some sort of land grab is going on. The Whites live on a 400-year-old property on prime Lake Ontario waterfront. The property should have been respected for its historic significance, but it wasn’t.


Re-examination of Janet White
 Ms. White’s bedroom has brick walls with no windows. Nonetheless, she is awakened by the noise of the wind turbines every night. At times she and her husband and their two children are all awake at 3:30 a.m.

Examination of Roger Olivera
 Mr. Olivera confirmed his former residence as receptor 232 of Phase II of the Melancthon wind facility. Mr. Olivera, a carpenter by trade, described his dream to build his own home. In 2001 he purchased the property and started construction. He moved into his new home in 2004.
 Mr. Olivera was in good health until November 2008 when the wind turbines began operating. Mr. Olivera’s sleep was severely impacted to the point where he could no longer function properly. He could no longer think straight and felt a sense of hopelessness and despair that something like this could be happening. Sleeping pills prescribed by his doctor worked at first, but then he started awakening again at night. He sought help from social workers and went to a walk-in clinic. He was advised to get away from his home. This advice was extremely upsetting; he had built his home with his own hands and was now going to lose it. He left his home because there was nothing else he could do in order to feel better. Mr. Olivera sold his home in 2011 at a loss. He is getting proper sleep now and is feeling better overall.


Cross-examination of Roger Olivera
 Mr. Olivera said that when he was driving home one day in 2005 he saw the Melancthon Phase I project. He had not received any notices and had not seen anything in the newspaper. When he went to the Township office for information he was referred to a website.
 Ms. Davis said that on the map it does seem that turbines are everywhere around Mr. Olivera’s property and that whenever Mr. Olivera was outside his home, no matter where he looked, he was going to see turbines. Mr. Olivera agreed with the comments. He agreed that the wind project felt like an intrusion.
 Ms. Davis went on to note that Mr. Olivera was not only seeing the turbines but hearing them. Mr. Olivera said he would be awakened in the middle of the night by the noise. Whenever he woke up, he could hear the turbines.
 Ms. Davis asked Mr. Olivera if the noise hadn’t been turbines but had been a highway instead would it have bothered him. Mr. Olivera thought that a highway possibly might have. Ms. Davis asked whether it would have bothered him if the municipality had thought it a good idea to erect a huge condominium. Mr. Olivera said probably not because there would be no noise.


ERT Panel Questions: Heather Gibbs asked about the impact of the turbines on the property. Mr. Olivera said that the closest turbine was 481 m from his property. Ms. Davis interrupted to ask Mr. Olivera whether this is the distance to the property or to the centre of the residence. Mr. Olivera believed it to be to the corner of his property. He was not aware that the MOE measures to the centre of a residence.",2014-05-04T05:48:05.359040,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Chatham-Kent', 'adminArea5': 'Raleigh', 'postalCode': 'N0P', 'formattedAddress': 'Raleigh, Chatham-Kent, ON, Canada'}, 'coords': [-82.12924, 42.251496]}",wamoGSLsR_uIit2KFwceig,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2014-01-16T13:28:00.000Z,42825-673,ushahidi,Tribunal Witnesses in Ontario,"[{'name': 'Nausea', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Vertigo', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Headaches', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Audible', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Sleep disturbance', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Skin irritations', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Social disruption', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'cardiac arrythmias', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:30:37.833677,Canada,ON,Chatham-Kent,Raleigh,"Raleigh, Chatham-Kent, ON, Canada",N0P,,"{'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Chatham-Kent', 'adminArea5': 'Raleigh', 'postalCode': 'N0P', 'formattedAddress': 'Raleigh, Chatham-Kent, ON, Canada'}","[-82.12924, 42.251496]",42.251496,-82.12924,Nausea,Vertigo,Headaches,en
2014-05-09 19:30:35.748201,"The wind farm on the Warpel was finished a few weeks ago. Now many people wonder how safe is the new wind turbine. It is the first of its size in the Kassel area.

Amount of damage unclear

Regarding the amount of the damage and the cause of lightning the Municipal works could at the weekend to give any information. Actually, the accident would not have happened so, because the systems are equipped with special lightning rods. That is, when the lightning strikes, the current is controlled drain to the ground so that it can do no harm. The protection system has in the storm on Friday evening but obviously does not work.

Technicians of the manufacturer, Vestas off on Saturday morning from the damaged windmill and began researching the causes, announced Ingo Pijanka, spokesman for the Municipal Works Kassel. These operate the new wind farm. Yet the cause of the failure of the lightning protection system is completely unclear Pijanka said at the weekend. The studies would show whether there might have a defect or whether it was an extraordinary flash.

The latter could well be said of the Kassel Professor Albert Claudi, an expert on Hochsprannungstechnik, at the request of HNA. The lightning rod in wind turbines are oriented only up to a certain current, which will not be exceeded in more than 99 percent of all lightning. Should not prove that the technique is defective or was installed incorrectly, it had probably been an extremely strong flash with more than 100,000 amperes. For comparison, a hair dryer or shaver has less than one amp.

Low residual risk

The impact of such high-current lightning am taken for technical equipment such as wind turbines and power lines as small residual risk. Because to protect themselves against such exception lightning arresters with appropriate, be prohibitively expensive. Because these cases are so rare, it is therefore statistically more favorable to plan for the cost of the damage.",2014-05-04T05:47:36.614131,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'NI', 'adminArea1': 'Germany', 'adminArea4': 'Hildesheim', 'adminArea5': 'Söhre', 'streetAddress': '2 Trauerberg', 'postalCode': '31199', 'formattedAddress': '2 Trauerberg, 31199 Söhre'}, 'coords': [9.963369, 52.101451]}",GtECa_b9QNKt2ofTAEaxRA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2014-01-16T12:53:00.000Z,42825-672,ushahidi,Lightning strikes breaks off tip of blade,"[{'name': 'Blade throw', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:30:35.748201,Germany,NI,Hildesheim,Söhre,"2 Trauerberg, 31199 Söhre",31199,2 Trauerberg,"{'adminArea3': 'NI', 'adminArea1': 'Germany', 'adminArea4': 'Hildesheim', 'adminArea5': 'Söhre', 'streetAddress': '2 Trauerberg', 'postalCode': '31199', 'formattedAddress': '2 Trauerberg, 31199 Söhre'}","[9.963369, 52.101451]",52.101451,9.963369,Blade throw,,,en
2014-05-09 19:30:35.919805,"UPPER THUMB — The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality investigated a diesel oil spill last week at the NextEra Energy Pheasant Run wind project near Brookfield Township.

“It was very small — very small,” said Robin Oeming, of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality about the spill. “There are no issues.” 

Oeming said he didn’t know how the spill occurred. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources also observed the cleanup.

Steve Stengel of NextEra Energy said Friday that the company reacted quickly to the spill and chopped up ice that the oil was in to be quickly disposed of.

NextEra said it was a small spill of less than 15 gallons, and it had a crew of workers at the site last week cleaning it up. The DEQ estimated the spill was even smaller than NextEra’s estimate, and noted the spill was not a high concern.

“It was 10 gallons — or 12 gallons at the most,” Oeming said. Oeming added there was no threat to animal or environmental health as result of the spill.",2014-05-04T05:47:40.058558,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'MI', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Huron Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Owendale', 'streetAddress': '8438 Sebewaing Rd', 'postalCode': '48754', 'formattedAddress': '8438 Sebewaing Rd, Owendale, MI 48754'}, 'coords': [-83.314802, 43.729316]}",LgQwu6o9R_SO4p7FzThtkQ,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2014-01-16T09:19:00.000Z,42825-671,ushahidi,Oil spills at wind project,"[{'name': 'oil leaks', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:30:35.919805,United States,MI,Huron Co.,Owendale,"8438 Sebewaing Rd, Owendale, MI 48754",48754,8438 Sebewaing Rd,"{'adminArea3': 'MI', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Huron Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Owendale', 'streetAddress': '8438 Sebewaing Rd', 'postalCode': '48754', 'formattedAddress': '8438 Sebewaing Rd, Owendale, MI 48754'}","[-83.314802, 43.729316]",43.729316,-83.314802,oil leaks,,,en

The November blade failure at the Orangeville Wind Farm may not be an isolated incident, as other wind farms across the country have had similar troubles.

In addition to Orangeville, wind farms in Illinois and Michigan have also experienced failures, involving 1.6-100 megawatt turbines manufactured by General Electric (GE).

The first blade failure occurred in June 2012 at the Settlers Trail Wind Farm near Sheldon, Illinois, operated by E.On Climate & Renewables out of Chicago. That incident was followed by another break in November 2012, at the California Ridge Wind Farm in Eastern Central Illinois.

Of the most recent breaks, the first occurred on Nov. 7 at the Echo Wind Park in Michigan. Echo is owned by Detroit-based DTE Energy, which experienced a previous break at its Thumb Wind Park in March. Thumb is also located in Michigan. Echo Wind Park was still under construction at the time of the break, but Thumb Wind Park was already operating. 

California Ridge experienced another failure earlier this year on Nov. 20, three days after the break at Orangeville. Both Orangeville and California Ridge are owned by Invenergy.

Each blade failure involved a similar instance wherein the blades broke off and fell to the ground near the base of the turbines.

Each wind farm ceased operations and shut down following the failures. Investigations were also launched by E.On Climate and Renewables, DTE and Invenergy on their respective wind farm with GE.

GE and Invenergy’s investigation involved not only the individual blade that failed, but all other blades at the wind farm as well.

At the Dec. 12 Orangeville town board meeting, Invenergy Eastern Regional Operations Manager Chris Meehan said Invenergy had launched an investigation into the failure, and that pieces of the broken blade had been sent to a lab for analysis. Invenergy was also reviewing all production records of each blade in an effort to find the cause of the failure, Meehan said. 

Four days after the board meeting, Invenergy also released a statement explaining that an investigation into the failure had been launched, and that the rest of the blades in Orangeville had been launched.

“The process is ongoing, as GE personnel makes its way through the Orangeville fleet, turbine by turbine,” the statement read.

GE also released a statement Dec. 16 blaming the root cause of the blade failure on a spar cap manufacturing anomaly. The spar cap is part of the wind turbine blade.

“GE has identified a discrete set of blades that could have been subject to this anomaly and we are working with potentially affected customers to help ensure the reliability of our turbines and their safe operation,” the statement read.

GE did not specify whether those customers included other wind farms such as California Ridge, Thumb or Echo.

GE also wrote that a small percentage of potentially affected blades reviewed had been impacted and unaffected blades are safe for operation. 

During the Orangeville Town Board meeting, Meehan said 112 blades from Orangeville have been cleared , and 21 turbines have had all three of their blades cleared. However, Meehan did not say whether the clearing had anything to do with their spar caps.

In order to prevent future failures, GE wrote that it has taken measures, including resourcing GE inspectors who are performing additional quality reviews and data verification. GE also wrote that there will be oversight from GE Engineering.

Also at the Dec. 12 board meeting, Orangeville resident Kathy Jensen asked Meehan if the California Ridge and Orangeville Wind Farm failures were related.

Meehan said Invenergy did not know the root cause of the California Ridge failure, but GE was confident they were not from the same failure mechanism.",2014-05-04T05:47:59.531154,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'NY', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Wyoming Co.', 'formattedAddress': 'Orangeville, NY', 'adminArea5': 'Orangeville'}, 'coords': [-78.270395, 42.745629]}",8ziVUhDCQBur8x8WHM9zfQ,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2014-01-08T10:59:00.000Z,42825-669,ushahidi,Orangeville Not alone in wind turbine failure,"[{'name': 'Blade throw', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:30:38.515254,United States,NY,Wyoming Co.,Orangeville,"Orangeville, NY",,,"{'adminArea3': 'NY', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Wyoming Co.', 'formattedAddress': 'Orangeville, NY', 'adminArea5': 'Orangeville'}","[-78.270395, 42.745629]",42.745629,-78.270395,Blade throw,,,en

SCITUATE — For some residents of the Driftway, Scituate’s wind turbine will cause more than 60 hours of shadow flicker per year, a study report says.

The eight Scituate homes most affected by shadow flicker experience more than 10 hours of flicker per year, according to the study, which was presented to the town’s selectmen Tuesday.

The company that did the study, EAPC Wind Energy of Vermont, determined that one home will be exposed to 69 hours of the strobe-like phenomenon per year, and two others will be exposed to more than the state-recommended maximum of 30 hours.

EAPC used a combination of weather records and data collected from receptors to project how much shadow flicker will occur.

Shadow flicker is the term for alternating periods of light and darkness caused by a wind turbine’s rotation.

The angle of the sun determines where a turbine’s shadows fall, but when it comes to measuring shadow flicker, the amount of sunlight let into a home is less important than the number of hours per day the turbine runs, according to the study.

“We found that the size of a receptor doesn’t make that much of a difference, but the hours the turbine is operational makes a huge difference,” said Chester Harvey, Geographic Information Systems specialist for EAPC Wind Energy.

Since 2012, some Scituate residents who live near the town’s turbine have complained of headaches, nausea and trouble sleeping. Some brought their concerns to the State House in July.

Though a state-mandated health impact study did not link shadow flicker to health problems, it advised that people not be exposed to more than 30 hours of flicker per year.

The selectmen briefly discussed several possibilities, including technology that would shut down the turbine when shadow flicker occurs.",2014-05-04T05:47:54.930934,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'MA', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Plymouth Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Scituate', 'streetAddress': '18 Allen Pl', 'postalCode': '02066', 'formattedAddress': '18 Allen Pl, Scituate, MA 02066'}, 'coords': [-70.725863, 42.195929]}",HR4kiZNfT2SS0jtFrEg-Tw,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2014-01-08T10:56:00.000Z,42825-668,ushahidi,Shadow Flicker in Scituate MA,"[{'name': 'Nausea', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Headaches', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Sleep disturbance', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Flicker', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:30:36.744694,United States,MA,Plymouth Co.,Scituate,"18 Allen Pl, Scituate, MA 02066",02066,18 Allen Pl,"{'adminArea3': 'MA', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Plymouth Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Scituate', 'streetAddress': '18 Allen Pl', 'postalCode': '02066', 'formattedAddress': '18 Allen Pl, Scituate, MA 02066'}","[-70.725863, 42.195929]",42.195929,-70.725863,Nausea,Headaches,Sleep disturbance,en

2014-05-09 19:30:36.831502,"With work soon to resume on the Prairie Breeze Wind Energy farm, The Elgin Review has learned that a number of blades will have to be replaced on wind turbine towers already erected.
 Statements from Invenergy (owner of the wind energy farm) and General Electric (maker of the blades) on Friday indicate the completion of the energy farm could be pushed back due to having to change out a significant number of blades.
“Due to a blade manufacturing defect, and following extensive consultation, GE (General Electric) is replacing a limited number of the turbine blades that will be utilized on turbines at the Prairie Breeze Wind Energy Center,” said Alissa Krinsky, communications director for Invenergy, based out of Chicago. “We have confidence in GE’s assessment and in the reliability of the replacement blades, and appreciate the patience of our project land owners and others in the community, as the blades are delivered to the project site.”
Katelyn Buress, speaking on behalf of General Electric, said “GE has identified a discrete set of blades that have been impacted by an anomaly in the manufacturing process. In order to ensure the reliability of our wind turbines, we are working with Invenergy to replace blades from the Prairie Breeze wind farm that were a part of this subset.
“Blades that are not impacted are safe to operate … The quality and reliability of GE turbines is of utmost importance to us and we are proud of our quality track record.”
At the end of November, in a press release updating the status of the wind farm construction, no mention was made of any wind turbine blades needing to be replaced.
 At that time, it appeared that the last large deliveries of turbine blades was to be completed in several weeks.
 Completion of the wind farm has been targeted for the first quarter of 2014.",2014-05-04T05:47:50.393449,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'NE', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Antelope Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Neligh', 'streetAddress': '853rd Rd', 'postalCode': '68756', 'formattedAddress': '853rd Rd, Neligh, NE 68756'}, 'coords': [-98.046519, 42.190245]}",tEsOUCzpRZyI4XcRHjdeNQ,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2014-01-03T08:37:00.000Z,42825-667,ushahidi,"Due To ‘Anomaly’, Some Wind Turbine Blades Must Be Replaced","[{'name': 'Blade throw', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:30:36.831502,United States,NE,Antelope Co.,Neligh,"853rd Rd, Neligh, NE 68756",68756,853rd Rd,"{'adminArea3': 'NE', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Antelope Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Neligh', 'streetAddress': '853rd Rd', 'postalCode': '68756', 'formattedAddress': '853rd Rd, Neligh, NE 68756'}","[-98.046519, 42.190245]",42.190245,-98.046519,Blade throw,,,en

- David and Molly Ford - building owners;
- Sol Coast Consulting and Design - performed project coordination, construction, and community workday oversite.
- Mike Vaughn, local landscape designer & Coos Bay City Council member - contracted by Sol Coast to complete the design; 
- Maria Cahill of Green Girl Land Development - sizing, hydraulic functions and modelling consultation. 
- Those above, Surfrider-Coos Bay Chapter, and Coos Watershed Association (CWA) - brought out volunteers for the workday. CWA also provided tools.

* Site prep - Sol Coast took care of asphalt removal, soil de-compaction and amending, and downspout extention to the OFG. The native soils at this site are sand, so Sol Coast just needed to excavate down to that level for drainage and build up healthy, drainable soils from there. Composted soils were mixed in with native soils.

* Materials - In western Oregon, Rexius is a “go to” business for compost amendments that meet the specifications for healthy plants and drainage concerns. The plants were selected by a local landscape designer to blend a desired aesthetic with non-invasive, robust species that require little maintenance. They made sure to avoid invasive species. Sol Coast also coordinated tools.

* Workday outreach and coordination - Sol Coast timed construction activities with weather patterns to target a “go” date and put together a request for volunteers to the free Garden Assistance Party (GAP).

Northern Pass clears power grid hurdle
Antrim zoning ordinance would allow wind farms
 
GROTON — When former Boston Police Patrolman Mario Rampino moved in 1996 to a small cabin at the top of Groton Hollow Road along Clark Brook, he thought he had found his dream home.

Rampino, 71, a former U.S. Army infantryman who served in Vietnam for three years, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. He left Boston because he needed peace and quiet and the shelter of the woods.


He had just what he needed for more than a decade, a peaceful home where he could be by himself. And then, in 2010-2011, the Groton wind farm was built. With it came an operations building that was built across from his home, without a question to him as to his wishes.


Now, Clark Brook has been ruined for fishing by the construction of the building, he says, and cars and trucks pass his house daily on what has become a busy road, he said. He's lost his privacy, and he has gained unwanted noise.


He has to move, but he doesn't have the money, and no one will buy his home, he said.

""It's the death of a dream,"" Rampino said. ""It's torture for me to be here now. I'm afraid to walk outside. They don't ask the abutters when they do these things.""


Groton Wind LLC, a 24-turbine, 48-megawatt wind-energy company, was built with the state's approval. The project, built by parent company Iberdrola Renewables of Spain, arranged to build an operations building for the plant that was supposed to be on the east side of the road and to the east of Clark Brook, one of Rampino's favorite trout fishing spots.


In 2011, Groton Wind moved its building plans, deciding instead to build on the west side of Groton Hollow Road and the west side of Clark Brook.

Rampino and his lawyer, Justin Richardson of Upton and Hatfield in Portsmouth, claim that change was not filed properly with the state's Site Evaluation Committee.


""I don't believe the SEC would have allowed the change of location for the building had they known it would affect an abutter so adversely,"" Richardson said.

The SEC will be holding hearings on Rampino's legal brief and the claims of others, including the state fire marshal, that the company did not file the planned changes to its facility with the proper authority.


Groton Wind did not submit new building, site and fire protection plans for to the state fire marshal prior to or during construction, according to state officials. The SEC said the hearings will determine if Groton Wind's operation certificate should be removed.


Rampino is hoping for relief of some sort that will allow him to move.

""I'm not asking for a lot of money, but I do have to start over and I want to be treated fairly,"" he said.

Neighbor Cheryl Lewis said, ""When these big companies come in, they don't think of the little guy.""


Iberdrola's Paul Copleman said the company hopes to avoid cases like Rampino's.

""We work hard to earn the trust and respect of landowners and stakeholders at all of our plants. We were surprised that Mr. Rampino continues to have concerns, as we believed we had reached an amicable understanding with him directly, but we'll continue to work with him and all stakeholders to resolve any outstanding questions,"" Copleman said.


Rampino knows that town residents will receive ongoing payments from Groton Wind that are roughly equivalent to the town's yearly budget.

""But the rest of the town doesn't have to deal with this building being where it is now,"" he said. ""I say to people who want wind power, let them try and live here now. I couldn't sell this place now if I wanted to.""",2014-05-04T05:47:58.391266,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'NH', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Grafton Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Rumney', 'streetAddress': '334 Groton Hollow Rd', 'postalCode': '03266', 'formattedAddress': '334 Groton Hollow Rd, Rumney, NH 03266'}, 'coords': [-71.796181, 43.781773]}",KevABtRWQKaaJoCN9OilZg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2014-01-02T09:54:00.000Z,42825-666,ushahidi,Man says Groton Wind turbine project turned his dream house into nightmare,"[{'name': 'Unsold property', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Audible', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Social disruption', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Reduced property values', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:30:38.416993,United States,NH,Grafton Co.,Rumney,"334 Groton Hollow Rd, Rumney, NH 03266",03266,334 Groton Hollow Rd,"{'adminArea3': 'NH', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Grafton Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Rumney', 'streetAddress': '334 Groton Hollow Rd', 'postalCode': '03266', 'formattedAddress': '334 Groton Hollow Rd, Rumney, NH 03266'}","[-71.796181, 43.781773]",43.781773,-71.796181,Unsold property,Audible,Social disruption,en

2014-05-09 19:30:36.654705,"It happened again, Hoosac Wind was making a racket last night and this morning (Sunday) and still feeling a bit tired and was hoping to sleep in. But no way, as the turbines were loud and making a thumping sound. It's been one year since Hoosac Wind has been in operation and we are any closer to a resolution of the noise. There are laws in Massachusetts regulating noise levels, and a number of complaints have been made by neighbors yet we still suffer from lack of sleep and other issues from the project. The turbines are loud enough to hear inside our house and make sleep difficult if not impossible at times. When are you going to do something to resolve our suffering? Don't any of you care about us, or are we to be sacrificed so others don't have to feel guilty about living in unsustainable ways? I'm at the point of being beyond upset! We live in small rural communities and have an industrial wind generation plant forced upon us that at times makes a racket and there isn't an immediate response. If my neighbors next door on my street were making as much noise, we could call the police, and they would respond and force the neighbors to be quiet or else. But my neighbors, Iberdrola get away with it not just one night, but many nights. Sometimes for nights on end and now with the arrival of Winter it will be more often. I wouldn't wish this on anyone, even those who have done this or let it happen to us, although there would be some justice in that. We deserve to enjoy our homes and properties and to feel safe. Our home used to be a place where we could relax from the rigors of life and enjoy peace and quite, now we have the neighbors from Hell and you are letting it happen. Enjoy sleeping well at night, because we aren't, but maybe that's none of your concern?


Not sleeping well from the noise is the main issue here, although I've noticed some ringing in the ears and pressure as well. Also prone to aggravation and other emotional responses as well. I've had a couple of episodes where I wake as if from a nightmare only there is no bad dream of threat apparent.

2014-05-09 19:30:38.297054,"December 16, 2013 (Campo) – A wind turbine on a ridge overlooking the Golden Acorn Casino exploded today, sparking several spot fires in surrounding brush that collectively charred about a half an acre.

David Elliott, a Manzanita tribal member, lives about  quarter of a mile from the wind facility on the neighboring Campo reservation. At first, he mistook the fire sounds for gusty wind. Then he walked outside and saw the turbine burning.  “The turbine did start several spot fires,” he said.  “If the wind had been coming from the northwest or west then my home, one of the closets homes to the turbines, would have definitely been in danger because we have brush on this side of the turbines and we would have had a major fire.”  Hear audio of his interview with ECM: http://kiwi6.com/file/bk3qywd787

Elliott says in recent days, he and his wife have been hearing unusual turbine noises. “Sounds like the bearings are going out on many of them…They screech and they howl…It sounds like many of them are pretty much ready for an overhaul,” he stated. 

A spotter plane, two bomber planes and a helicopter responded, Elliott said, adding that the fixed wing aircraft “weren’t able to do a real good job because of high winds…The helicopter came in and actually saved the day.”

Retired Cal Fire Battalion Chief Mark Ostrander told ECM the scenario could have been far worse.  “Luckily it was not during a Santa Ana,” said Ostrander, who has long warned that wind turbines pose fire hazards in the backcountry.

A red flag alert for high fire danger was in effect just one day earlier, but had been lifted by today.  Moreover while windy, the gusts were not approaching the speeds that occur in the area during Santa Ana Winds on this cool, winter day with some humidity in the air. 

Even with such favorable weather conditions, it took a response from multiple agencies including Cal-Fire, the U.S. Forest Service, Heartland Fire and possibly others to bring the blazes under control.

The project is currently offline, ECM news partner 10 News reports.  The nacelle of the turbine was destroyed; cost of damage has not yet been released but a typical turbine cost runs in the millions.

Mike Mohler of Cal Fire told ECM the cause has not yet been determined. He stated that there were no problems for aircraft to drop redardant, though Elliott’s eyewitness account raises questions on the effectiveness of the drops. 

The Campo turbines are far shorter than the new turbines approved by the federal and county governments for Iberdrola’s Tule Wind project in nearby McCain Valley, where approximately a hundred turbines would tower 500 feet tall. Ostrander and others have raised concerns that aerial fire drops would be ineffective at such heights, forcing ground crews to stand back and wait for the fire to burn out of the wind facility before battling what could, by then, be an inferno.

East County Magazine has contacted the Campo tribal office for comment but has not received a response.

Gamesa,  manufacturer of turbines at the Kumeyaay Wind facility in Campo, has a troubled track record of turbines that have caught fire, as well as washing its hands of responsibility for blade failures including those at the same facility where today’s fire occurred..

On May 22, 2012, a Gamesa turbine caught fire at Iberdrola’s Barton 2 Wind Power Project in Iowa, North American Windpower reported. A Gamesa spokesman claimed the company’s maintenance contract had expired.

Gamesa turbines have also been linked to two turbine fires in Pennsylvania, including Iberdrola’s Locust Ridge project in 2009 and another fire at North Allegheny Ridge (not owned by Iberdrola) in 2012. Iberdrola previously had issues with Gamesa turbine blades whirling off chunks of turbine debris at the same facility. ECM has previously reported on these issues and other turbine safety concerns in an April 4, 2012 report, “The Dark Side of Green.”

Both Gamesa and Vestas have warned of problems in older models installed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. However fires at plants with more recent installations make clear that fire and safety issues have still not been adequately addressed.

Gamesa refused to accept liability in five legal actions filed by U.S. wind projects over warranty disputes for hefty repairs and lost production, ECM reported back in August 2012 in a story documenting numerous problems with wind turbines. That includes $34.5 million in turbine repairs at the Kumeyaay Wind Farm in on the Campo Indian reservation. A witness told ECM that he saw a blue flash that radiated out through the wind farm during a storm in December 2009 before the project went dark. All 75 blades on all 25 turbines were replaced and the facility was offline for three months.

Gamesa blades suffered from “design and manufacturing defects,” the suits allege, Recharge News has reported. In December 2011, Recharge reported that Infigen, which recently took over the Campo project, had sent a bill to Kumeyaay after the company was unable to get Gamesa to pay up. Kumeyaay has been disputing the claim, contending that Gamesa operated the project for five years. The Campo wind farm was built by Pattern Energy, which listed the Campo project among its “successes” in its application to the California Public Utilities Commission to build Ocotillo Express wind in Ocotillo, California.

Gamesa isn’t the only turbine maker with a troubled record. As previously noted, Vestas has been plagued with problems. Last week in Tehachapi, a turbine built by Danish manufacturer NEG Micon burst into flames. In June, a wind turbine fire in the Whitewater area of Riverside County charred 367 acres after spreading to become a wild land fire despite the required clearance around turbine bases; fire authorities have not released the name of the turbine maker. The fire, which forced evacuations of homes, could have been far worse had not a witness reported it promptly to 911.

Nor are fires and serious safety issues limited to turbines. In Hawaii, on August 2, 2012 a fire destroyed a battery warehouse at First Wind’s Kahuka wind farm. A previous fire had also occurred in the battery facility in April 2011, the Honolulu Star Advertiser reports. The battery energy storage system designed by Xtreme Power of Texas had been touted as a solution to power spikes.

In 2009, a GE wind turbine broke in half at a New York wind facility owned by Enel, a company seeking to build a wind project in East County’s Jewel Valley. GE, which has also had problems with ice throws off turbines, now recommends that turbines be sited a safe distance from occupied structures, roads or areas used by the public. In May 2012, GE expanded its wind operations by acquiring the wind division of ENRON , the energy company that had its chief executives convicted of fraud following energy market manipulations. Is this a company whose products should be entrusted to protect public safety?

In McCain Valley, site of the proposed Tule Wind facility, turbines up to 450 feet tall with wing spans the size of football fields would be located just 455 feet from the main roadway and just 760 feet from a campground, Iberdrola told ECM. Moreover there is only one road in and one road out of the long valley. What happens if a turbine collapses or worse, a turbine sparks a fire while campers are present? Or ice is hurled off blades?

Most recently, a wind turbine sparked a wildland fire in the Netherlands on October 30, 2013.  View a photo here: http://nieuws.nl/algemeen/20131030/Brand-windmolen-Verlies-collegas-hartverscheurend

Bonnie Price, past president of the East County Democratic Club, tried unsuccessfully to persuade the county and state Democratic parties to support a resolution calling for a ban on wind turbines in high fire-risk areas of East County.  In response to today’s fire at the Campo wind facility, she wrote, “Sad to report, wind turbines do what many deniers say they cannot do.  Chalk up another hit for SDG&E""s archaic and dangerous grid system using alternative energy resources badly.”

On the Brush Fire Partyline on Facebook, local residents sounded off as well.

“Millions of our tax dollars up in smoke,” wrote Jan Whistler-Clark.

Kelly Fuller posted, “More of these wind turbines are being planned in the eastern back country, where fire stations have been dark (no staff) for many days this summer and fall. Boulevard in particular. The fire risk is real.”

Ironically, today’s fire comes just days after the Bureau of Indian Affairs just issuing a finding of No Significant Impact for a new 1 megwatt wind turbine planned by the truck stop at Golden Acorn Casino in Boulevard.

“The process is all so corrupt, in my opinion,” concluded Donna Tisdale, chair of the Boulevard Planning Commission and cofounder of the Protect Our Communities Foundation, one of multiple community and environmental groups that has filed suit seeking to halt the proposed Tule Wind project in McCain Valley.

Although SDG&E provided mitigation for its Sunrise Powerlink Project in McCain Valley, a foam truck  provided as supposed mitigation is currently housed nearly an hour away in Morena Valley due to inconsistent staffing at the Boulevard Fire Station, ECM learned during a recent meeting with Supervisor Dianne Jacob , residents and fire officials. Overtime has been authorized to restore staffing, but it is unclear when or if the foam truck will be moved closer to the Boulevard-Campo area where major wind projects, substations and power lines all pose fire risks.

The prospect of a wind turbine sparking a brush fire in McCain Valley has residents such as David Elliott alarmed.  “It’s a huge concern,” he concluded. “I’m sure that houses would be burned down and lives could be lost.”",2014-05-04T05:48:01.834517,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'CA', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'San Diego Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Campo', 'streetAddress': '949 Sheridan Rd', 'postalCode': '91906', 'formattedAddress': '949 Sheridan Rd, Campo, CA 91906'}, 'coords': [-116.469732, 32.607579]}",1BP_mAJoQM6HZWqFBlv9mQ,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-12-17T12:59:00.000Z,42825-658,ushahidi,"WIND TURBINE EXPLODES, SPARKS BRUSH FIRE IN CAMPO","[{'name': 'Turbine Fires', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Fires caused by turbines', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:30:38.297054,United States,CA,San Diego Co.,Campo,"949 Sheridan Rd, Campo, CA 91906",91906,949 Sheridan Rd,"{'adminArea3': 'CA', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'San Diego Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Campo', 'streetAddress': '949 Sheridan Rd', 'postalCode': '91906', 'formattedAddress': '949 Sheridan Rd, Campo, CA 91906'}","[-116.469732, 32.607579]",32.607579,-116.469732,Turbine Fires,Fires caused by turbines,,en
2014-05-09 19:30:39.645477,"THE storm force winds experienced in Donegal on Thursday caused the blade of a wind turbine near Killybegs to break off.

The five turbine wind farm at Corkermore was recently granted planning permission for a further four turbines to be erected.

Fine Gael Councillor John Boyle lives close to the wind farm which generates 10 megawatts from the five turbines.

Speaking to the Donegal News, he said a section of blade around 10 feet long broke of and fell to the ground beside the turbine.

“It didn’t do any damage and there was no one near it. I can only presume it was the very strong winds which caused it to break off,” Cllr Boyle said.
 Around ten years ago he sold land to the developers on which two of the five turbines are sited. 

“Some people might be concerned but there are five or six neighbours around here for who it would be no problem. There was absolutely no danger,” he added.
 However locals who had unsuccessfully appealed the recent planning permission for four more turbines to An Bord Pleanala will be concerned about the falling blade, particularly in light of the collapse of a wind turbine at Maas near Ardara in high winds in March.

The site of the Corkermore wind farm is nine kilometres north-east of Killybegs.
 The owners of Corkermore Wind Farm Limited stated the broken blade section was found 30m from the wind turbine and is now under investigation by its manufacturer Gamesa as to the cause of the incident.

“The individual turbine brought itself to a stop automatically and there was no damage to any other turbines or facilities on the site which is in an isolated area. Gamesa technical staff are examining the single turbine affected and will also carry out precautionary checks on each of the turbines on site,” a company spokesperson said.

The Glenties Windfarm Information Group has called on the County Council to investigate the matter sying it is just 500 metres from a house.

SAMSUNG CAMERA PICTURES

A mother of two teenage children who lives only 500 metres from a wind turbine at the Corkermore site where a rotor blade broke of in last week’s storm, has for the first time spoken publicly about wind farms.

On reading the comments in the Donegal News last Friday from Cllr John Boyle that their was ‘no danger’ from the sheared blade, Ms Carol Duddy contacted this paper.
 She got planning permission for her home six years ago in the Corkermore area when there was no mention of erecting wind turbines.

“Cllr Boyle said the turbines were no problem for the neighbours – he wasn’t speaking for me and I live closest to one. I am not happy with the noise and the flicker effect and I am particularly concerned that a blade could brake off. What would have happened if it had hit someone or my house?

“We have seen a turbine collapse and if one of these did it would not be far from my back door,” Ms Duddy said.

She contacted Donegal County Council after the blade broke off last week and was told it had nothing to do with them.
“I am very annoyed and they are looking to erect another four of these turbines – my house actually vibrates.

“Up until now I have said nothing as I just wanted to keep the peace but now I want to know who is answerable if something happens. I rang the windfarm operators and the Health and Safety Authority and no one has come back to me,” Ms Duddy concluded.

2014-05-09 19:30:39.382207,"VERMILION Co., IL.  - This six year old girl is wearing her Hello Kitty headphones to bed in July 2013 because the wind turbines operating on the adjacent farm property is making too much noise.

This photo was taken at 10:43 PM after being in bed since 8:00 PM. 

The closest wind turbines are 1665’ and 2225’ away, they are 495’ tall GE 1.6 mW nameplate capacity, and they are owned/operated by InvEnergy in Vermilion County Illinois.

This scenario repeated for so many nights during each week that, within six months after this photo was taken, the parents and both children abandoned her home and moved into a doublewide trailer eight miles away in order to get away from the nighttime noise.

Now, she asks her parents on regular occasions, “When can we move back into our old house?” and “ I want to have a normal life and get to have my old bedroom back again because I don’t like living here because there’s not enough room for my stuff and there’s no place to keep my things.”  Her parents have gently reminded both kids that they love them very much and that their health is way more important than having material things such as a nice big house with all the toys and things.

Good parents know when they have to set priorities, and this family is making the right decision to inform the public so that other families do not have to suffer the grief and life changing setbacks caused by improper wind turbine siting.

2014-05-09 19:30:39.199041,"Imagine having an uninvited guest in your yard that never goes away- that’s how one Mars Hill Resident describes the wind farm just about a mile away from his property. He’s lived in his home for 23 years but the past six, he says, it hasn’t felt like home. Now, he’s asking the town for help. NewsSource 8′s Angela Christoforos has the story…

Mars Hill Resident Michael Gosselin said, “Typical week I’ll hear them 3 or 4 times a week.

Gosselin says the noise caused by the wind farm just over a mile away from his property has been a NUISANCE.

Gosselin said, ”It has ruined my everyday life cause I’m a combat wounded Veteran and I spend most of my day here at my residence and I moved up from 446 miles from Rhode Island to have peace and tranquility.”

Peace and tranquility that Gosselin says he no longer has ever since 28 wind turbines were placed on top of Mars Hill mountain in 2007.

“It sounds like a loud airplane overhead never leaving for it’s destination,” Gosselin said.

Gosselin says the noise became so disturbing that he built a sound proof bunker in his garage as a way to escape it. He’s asking the town to change the amount he’s being taxed on his property because according to him, he’s not able to enjoy it to it’s full extent. In order to be granted a tax abatement, Gosselin needs to prove his property is in fact worth less; and at this point he doesn’t have that data.

Broker and Owner of Remax Central Jane Towle said, ”In essence wind turbines are a relatively new concept across our country and there’s still a lot of unanswered questions as to whether they affect property values at all. The wind farm here in Mars Hill is the only wind farm here locally so there is no other area to compare it to in our region and so it makes it very difficult to determine whether property values are affected or not.”

Gosselin suffers from post traumatic stress disorder and says the noise gives him headaches. News Source 8 contacted Mars Hill town officials who say the turbines are operating within the “permitted guidelines for noise.” Gosselin also tried reaching out to First Wind; the company that owns the turbines. He’s asking for a settlement. If he doesn’t get that settlement he says he’s willing to take his petition as far as the Supreme Court.

Gosselin said, ”I’m going to take it all the way to the top I feel that strongly about it that it’s a violation of my civil rights, they took away my peace, tranquility, and happiness.”

A BLADE that flew off a wind turbine into a field earmarked for development could have killed someone, says a Copeland councillor.

The high winds were so strong last Thursday that an arm of the turbine at Seascale School flew off and landed 200 yards away in a field.

Concerned councillor David Moore said it was “potentially harmful” particularly as outline permission was granted six weeks ago by Copeland Council for 14 houses to be built on the site where the blade landed.

He said Seascale Parish Council and residents objected to the plans because the wind turbine is so close to the proposed housing development. But Copeland’s planning panel said there was no evidence the turbine was unsafe.

Coun Moore told The Whitehaven News this week: “The fact of the matter is there was no evidence then that they are unsafe. Now we know in extreme circumstances this can happen. If it’s happened before, it could happen again. This is the first time I have ever heard of a turbine blade flying off. It landed some 200 yards away and about 20 yards away from the road. The potential for harm is great,” he said.

He said fortunately on this occasion the two horses that graze on the land had stood close to the turbine for shelter and were unharmed.

Coun Moore raised his concerns at last week’s full council meeting, saying: “Members need to be aware that this circumstance has arisen. It’s happened here and it could have cost lives.”

Gillian Hartley, headteacher at Seascale Primary School, said the turbines are designed to work in high winds but last week’s weather was exceptional.

Mrs Hartley said: “It was extreme circumstances. Once the turbine is fixed it will be perfectly safe. The maintenance company don’t envisage it happening again.”

2014-05-09 19:07:43.035412,"Interactive Voice, a pioneer in voice-controlled electronics, is excited to announce that its newest Internet-connected device, ivee Sleek, is now available for retail purchase, shipping to Staples nationwide this month. 

Unveiled at the 2013 International CES in Las Vegas, ivee Sleek is the first Wi-Fi voice-activated assistant for the home that answers questions, obeys commands and controls other Internet-connected devices. Via the exclusive “my ivee” portal, users can easily connect ivee to their favorite Wi-Fi devices and view them through their computer, tablet or smartphone.

With more and more devices entering the steadily growing connected home market, which houses the potential to hit a global market value of $10 billion by 2014, according to ABI Research, ivee Sleek’s hit the ground running with an innovative and untapped niche. ivee offers users the ability to create a true connected home, one in which multiple devices run synchronously, but she doesn’t stop there. ivee Sleek expands upon the beginnings of voice recognition and personal assistant technology experienced through mobile phones and takes it to unprecedented level to create an artificial intelligence system that allows users to control their connected homes through simply the use of their voices.

At launch, ivee Sleek will understand and answer questions within 33 categories ranging from time and weather to stock prices, radio settings and more.  Just say ""hello ivee,"" and ivee Sleek will prompt you for a command. As soon as you start talking, ivee begins turning your words into actions. And, because her technology is cloud-based, she will continuously grow, becoming smarter and more personalized to both her owner and her surroundings. 

ivee Sleek currently works with platform solutions from iControl Networks, through which she has the ability to control other internet-connected devices, such as Wi-Fi thermostats, locks, smart plugs, security cameras and more. Come January, ivee Sleek will become integrated with Staples Connect. ivee is also currently working on partnerships that will allow her to control even more devices on her own.",2014-05-04T04:49:07.107010,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'CA', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Los Angeles Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Los Angeles', 'streetAddress': '114 W 1st St', 'postalCode': '90012', 'formattedAddress': '114 W 1st St, Los Angeles, CA 90012'}, 'coords': [-118.243685, 34.052234]}",N_pFFD3HRACSeHkX6mUprA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-12-10T16:37:00.000Z,24670-185,ushahidi,Voice Controlled Homes?

2014-05-09 19:30:40.983293,"Another Donegal wind turbine has been smashed – by high winds!

A blade on a turbine at Corkermore wind farm has snapped clean off and embedded in the ground below.

Just a month ago the site was given the go-ahead to add four new turbines by An Bord Pleanala.

The site of the windfarm is nine kilometres north-east of Killybegs.

An appeal was lodged against Donegal County Council awarding permission on a number of grounds including that it didn’t take correct note of public submissions, the impact of low level sound on human health as well as a potential negative impact on the environment, scenic beauty and tourism.

In its conclusion, An Bord Pleanala said the proposed development would not be likely to have any significant negative impacts on the environment in relation to the landscape, noise emissions, shadow flicker, slope stability, water quality or otherwise.

It concluded the proposed development would therefore be in keeping with proper planning and sustainable development of the area and can go ahead.

We have cut back our budget to a “bare-bones” level and fear that some of the necessities of life such as heat in the winter and food in our stomachs will be the next sacrifices to be made.  I’m sure you would be shocked if you knew the small amount of money we’re forced to live on for the rest of our days!  All of this while some foreign multi-national energy companies are getting wealthy off those same sacrifices by Ontario’s own people.  We will be paying ridiculous rates for our electricity while we subsidize the cost of power to other jurisdictions which are now using those savings against us by taking our jobs and our standard of living.

As the manufacturer of the system, the Aurich company "" Enercon ""on Friday to demand the NWZ   confirmed the complete nacelle had been dropped, including rotor blades. Single small parts found witnesses still on the road Krumlander. Enercon staff cordoned off the site even in the morning. ""We are glad that nothing happened,"" said company spokesman Felix Rehwald . When the wind turbine is the model ""E 40"" - ""not technologically comparable to today's models,"" the first gearless and loud Rehwald.

In addition to the installation concerned, which was built in 1995, are two more of the same type - one from 1995 and one from 1996. The gondola was ""dropped directly at the tower"", the operator of three plants said on Friday. The wind turbine is located on a wooded lot and not part of the wind farm Döhlen. It was built in 1995 as a so-called ""privileged projects"" in the outdoor area, according to the municipality. 

The wings of the other two wind turbines stand still since Friday morning. ""It was important for us to take the other two out of the wind,"" said Peter Nieslony , head of the Building Regulations Office at the county. The manufacturing company has been entrusted with the damage analysis. This is done in the factory Enercon in Aurich. All records of the wind turbine would be read aloud Nieslony now.

How long that will last, none of the parties could say. ""Only then can we decide what to do next,"" Nieslony said. If there is damage analysis to county and manufacturers want to sit together. Then you would see whether the incident could also allow conclusions on identical systems. ""In our area, it is the first incident with a E 40,"" said Nieslony, who also pointed to the extreme weather conditions in the incident. The type is still relatively widespread - not only in the county. But for now remain only the two adjacent plants.

According to Enercon spokesman Rehwald it was stated that the E 40 to the plant type, ""we currently most zurückbauen"". Gradually, the plants would be exchanged. Idea of ​​a ""repowering"" - replacing old equipment with new ones - have not had claims to be the operator. ""We are satisfied with the equipment, with the only condition not now."" But he also wanted to get together after the analysis with the manufacturer. The plant was insured by Enercon, now the damage control would be in the foreground.

Back in August, there had been an incident at a wind power plant in the district. In Iserloy a piece of a rotor blade had broken off and landed in a corn field. According Nieslony the manufacturer ""the system runs Vestas 'again.

Freescale Semiconductor (NYSE: FSL) is addressing the miniaturization trend with its new Kinetis KL02 MCU–the world’s smallest ARM Powered® MCU. The KL02 holds great potential for ultra-small-form-factor products in applications such as portable consumer devices, remote sensing nodes, wearable devices and ingestible healthcare sensing.

Measuring just 1.9 x 2.0 mm, the Kinetis KL02 MCU is 25 percent smaller than the industry’s next-smallest ARM® MCU. Within this miniscule device, Freescale has included the latest 32-bit ARM Cortex™-M0+ processor, cutting-edge low-power functionality and a range of analog and communication peripherals. This enables system designers to dramatically reduce the size of their boards and products while retaining the all-important performance, feature integration and power consumption characteristics of their end devices. In addition, space-constrained applications that previously couldn’t incorporate an MCU now can be upgraded to become smart applications, adding a new tier of devices to the IoT ecosystem.

2014-05-09 19:30:39.817442,"A transformer caught fire at the base of a Bigelow Canyon wind turbine over the weekend, spilling an estimated 600 gallons of transformer oil. 

#A representative of the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality’s (DEQ) spills unit reported that PGE, the owner of the wind farm, reported the fire and hired SMF Environmental to clean up the spill. DEQ asked for a spill report identifying what happened, what actions were taken to clean up the site and to restore it to its pre-spill condition. No waterways were affected.

#The transformer “over-pressurized, released oil and caught fire,” said Dale Coyle, Bigelow Canyon site manager. “When we got here it was at a slow burn.”

#Witnesses the evening of the event saw flames “boiling out” from the bottom of the wind tower. Winds were calm and the fire did not spread.

#While transformer failures like this one are not uncommon in the energy industry, happening more often in urban areas, Coyle said this was the first transformer fire among PGE’s 217 Sherman County wind turbines since Bigelow Canyon opened in 2007.

#Transformers are used throughout power transmission and distribution systems, Coyle explained, and each wind turbine has its own transformer. 

#“We actually monitor our transformers,” Coyle said, “where in distribution systems they typically don’t.” The 600 gallons of oil spilled was the full capacity of the burned transformer unit, which was near the corner of Oehman and Helms Creek roads. 

#Coyle said the wind tower itself didn’t appear to be damaged, but that an inspection and metallurgic examination had been called for.",2014-05-04T05:48:11.252976,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'OR', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Sherman Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Wasco', 'postalCode': '97065', 'formattedAddress': '97065, OR'}, 'coords': [-120.572277, 45.690404]}",SFWEUFiHScWVhja-4vbZNg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-12-01T08:40:00.000Z,42825-647,ushahidi,Oil Spill & Fire in Oregon,"[{'name': 'Turbine Fires', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'oil leaks', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:30:39.817442,United States,OR,Sherman Co.,Wasco,"97065, OR",97065,,"{'adminArea3': 'OR', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Sherman Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Wasco', 'postalCode': '97065', 'formattedAddress': '97065, OR'}","[-120.572277, 45.690404]",45.690404,-120.572277,Turbine Fires,oil leaks,,en

2014-05-09 19:09:58.323500,"Wouldn't it be great if King and Queen Street had ample space for bikes, streetcars and cars? Wouldn't it be even better if this could be accomplished with with minimum disruption or cost?

Here's the idea. Both King and Queen Street run parallel for the entire length of the downtown core. Both are four lanes wide. Both have streetcar tracks. Both allow on-street parking during non-rush hours. Both are used extensively by bicycle riders, but neither has dedicated bike lanes, or the space for them under the current configuration.

What if we changed King and Queen into one-way streets?

Take the right-hand curb lane and turn it into a dedicated two-way bicycle lane. The second lane from the right can continue to be used by streetcars, as it is today. But, now, what were previously opposing lanes of traffic can be used by cars to bypass stopped streetcars.

It's win-win-win for all involved. Cars can move much more freely. Streetcars no longer get jammed up behind left-turning cars at intersections. Cyclists get a safe, separated lane of traffic.

(For those wondering, 504 streetcars could be routed along Queen when westbound and 501 streetcars along King when eastbound, or vice versa. If we wanted to get really adventurous, we could explore the idea of a ""loop"" streetcar route.)",2014-05-04T05:14:51.171392,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Toronto', 'adminArea5': 'Toronto', 'streetAddress': '139 Spadina Ave', 'postalCode': 'M5V 2K8', 'formattedAddress': '139 Spadina Ave, Toronto, ON M5V 2K8, Canada'}, 'coords': [-79.395873, 43.64754]}",r7RD1LWWSJm2LchSF6Ek4Q,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-11-29T16:20:00.000Z,37336-90,ushahidi,"Multi-modal, one-directional arterial roads","[{'name': 'City Planning Process', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Public Transportation', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Roads & Highways', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Cycling', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:09:58.323500,Canada,ON,Toronto,Toronto,"139 Spadina Ave, Toronto, ON M5V 2K8, Canada",M5V 2K8,139 Spadina Ave,"{'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Toronto', 'adminArea5': 'Toronto', 'streetAddress': '139 Spadina Ave', 'postalCode': 'M5V 2K8', 'formattedAddress': '139 Spadina Ave, Toronto, ON M5V 2K8, Canada'}","[-79.395873, 43.64754]",43.64754,-79.395873,City Planning Process,Public Transportation,Roads & Highways,en
2014-05-09 19:30:40.897009,"SPAIN: A series of fires in the nacelles of four Alstom turbines at two neighbouring wind stations in the northern Spanish region of Navarra are under police investigation.

A regional government statement to the local press said firemen were called out three separate times on the night of November 8, between 20.00h and 22.00h, to tackle the four blazes, all extinguished by the local fire services.

The fires affected two Alstom ECO44-600kW and two ECO48-750kW machines at the 60MW Montes de Cierzo plant in the Tudela district and the 30MW La Bandera plant in Fustiñana, respectively. The affected machines, in operation for over a decade, were separated by several kilometres.

Some insiders place the blame on faults arising from reduced expenditure on operation and maintenance activity (O&M), due to the Spanish government's financial squeeze on wind operators. Suspicions of possible arson linked to layoffs were also expressed.

Alstom and the wind plant owner-developer Enhol decline to comment until police, insurance and technical investigations are complete.

Enhol told Windpower Monthly, however, that although operations at the two plants had been stopped following the fires, the company was now progressively powering up each turbine, following safety checks",2014-05-04T05:48:20.576850,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'Chartered Community of Navarre', 'adminArea1': 'Spain', 'adminArea5': 'Biurrun', 'streetAddress': 'Street', 'postalCode': '31398', 'formattedAddress': 'Street, 31398 Biurrun (Chartered Community of Navarre)'}, 'coords': [-1.676069, 42.695391]}",-BPewYwkThinm2d6o-lzZA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-11-29T13:03:00.000Z,42825-646,ushahidi,Fires in Spain,"[{'name': 'Turbine Fires', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:30:40.897009,Spain,Chartered Community of Navarre,,Biurrun,"Street, 31398 Biurrun (Chartered Community of Navarre)",31398,Street,"{'adminArea3': 'Chartered Community of Navarre', 'adminArea1': 'Spain', 'adminArea5': 'Biurrun', 'streetAddress': 'Street', 'postalCode': '31398', 'formattedAddress': 'Street, 31398 Biurrun (Chartered Community of Navarre)'}","[-1.676069, 42.695391]",42.695391,-1.676069,Turbine Fires,,,en

2014-05-09 19:29:22.183818,"From the link below. By John Upton.

Last summer, a leaky tank led to the shutdown of the Palisades nuclear power plant in Michigan. So plant owner Entergy patched up the leak, fired back up the reactor, and hoped for the best.

Unfortunately, the best did not materialize.

The tank began leaking again. But no worries, thought the Einsteins at Entergy, it was only leaking a gallon a day. That was OK, they figured, because the NRC had allowed it to leak up to 38 gallons a day. As of Friday, they were still doing that whole “hoping for the best” thing.

But on Saturday the leaky drip turned into a gush, and all the hoping in the world couldn’t hold back the tide of spilling radioactive water. Nearly 80 gallons of water containing small amounts of radioactive tritium and possibly trace amounts of cobalt and cesium spewed into Lake Michigan, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission told the AP.

Early Sunday morning, the tank was ruled inoperable and the nuclear power plant began powering down. This is reportedly the ninth time that the facility has been shut down since 2011.

If the city of lights can dim their lights, then there is no reason Toronto can’t as well (http://goo.gl/z4PFM6). 

This idea won’t cost the city any money – it will save it – but will make a big difference to light pollution – and on bird populations.

Firstly, Toronto is in the middle of one of the busiest migratory routes for birds in North America. Thousands of birds die downtown every year hitting the lights left on in buildings. 

Secondly, an abundance of light at night, has been known to disturb sleeping patterns, which impacts all sorts of health complications.

Lastly, with decreased light pollution, we’d be able to see the stars again!

Like plastic grocery bags, a simple by-law could start the dimming.

Most people on the subways have cell phones which they use for business; idle chit chat; anything to pass the time I guess.
 
However there are people like me who would prefer to remain silent, still; quiet on the subway.  If I'm lucky enough to find a seat, I want to read or just daydream until my ride is finally over.

2014-05-09 19:30:40.720172,"OAKWOOD — For the third time in 17 months, a wind turbine blade manufactured by General Electric has broken off at an East Central Illinois wind farm.

The latest incident occurred about 9 p.m. Nov. 20 in Vermilion County at the California Ridge Wind Farm operated by Chicago-based Invenergy. Another turbine blade broke in that same wind farm in November 2012, following a June 2012 blade break at the Settlers Trail Wind Farm near Sheldon, operated by Chicago-based E.On Climate & Renewables.

All three blades were on 1.6-megawatt turbines manufactured by GE.

“We are working with GE, the turbine manufacturer, to determine the cause of this incident,” a statement from Invenergy said Friday.

Last March, GE issued a statement saying that an “isolated manufacturing issue” caused the two wind turbines to break in 2012. GE said it had “reviewed the wind farm fleets at both sites to ensure their continued reliability and performance” and “have addressed the manufacturing issue to prevent this from happening in the future.”

GE officials did not immediately return a call requesting comment on the latest incident.

Invenergy said the blade broke off and fell to the ground near the base of the turbine, which is located near the intersection of 2150 North Road and 900 East Road near Oakwood.

“We believe that as this blade fell, it hit a second blade on the same turbine, causing that second blade also to break off and fall to the ground near the base,” the statement said. “As designed, the turbine automatically ceased operation. No one was injured.”

Invenergy’s 217-megawatt, 134-turbine California Ridge Wind Farm has been in operation since 2012. There are 30 turbines in Champaign County and 104 in Vermilion County.

E.On’s 150-megawatt, 94-turbine Settlers Trail Wind Farm was built in 2011 and is the second operational wind farm in Illinois for E.On. The firm also owns the Pioneer Trail Wind Farm near Paxton.

E.On last year said a turbine breaking is a “rare event for us.”

2014-05-09 19:30:40.539512,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A major U.S. power company has pleaded guilty to killing eagles and other birds at two Wyoming wind farms and agreed to pay $1 million as part of the first enforcement of environmental laws protecting birds against wind energy facilities.

Until the settlement announced Friday with Duke Energy Corp. and its renewable energy arm, not a single wind energy company had been prosecuted for a death of an eagle or other protected bird — even though each death is a violation of federal law, unless a company has a federal permit. Not a single wind energy facility has obtained a permit.

The Charlotte, N.C.-based company pleaded guilty to killing 14 eagles and 149 other birds at its Top of the World and Campbell Hill wind farms outside Casper, Wyo. All the deaths, which included golden eagles, hawks, blackbirds, wrens and sparrows, occurred from 2009 to 2013.

""Wind energy is not green if it is killing hundreds of thousands of birds,"" said George Fenwick, president of the American Bird Conservancy, which supports properly sited wind farms. ""The unfortunate reality is that the flagrant violations of the law seen in this case are widespread.""

There could be more enforcement. The Fish and Wildlife Service is investigating 18 bird-death cases involving wind-power facilities, and about a half-dozen have been referred to the Justice Department.

Wind farms are clusters of turbines as tall as 30-story buildings, with spinning rotors as wide as a passenger jet's wingspan. Though the blades appear to move slowly, they can reach speeds up to 170 mph at the tips, creating tornado-like vortexes. Eagles are especially vulnerable because they don't look up as they scan the ground for food, failing to notice the blades until it's too late.

""No form of energy generation, or human activity for that matter, is completely free of impacts, and wind energy is no exception,"" the American Wind Energy Association said in a statement.

The case against Duke Energy and Duke Energy Renewables Inc. was the first prosecuted under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act against a wind energy company. The Obama administration has championed pollution-free wind power and used the same law against oil companies and power companies for drowning and electrocuting birds.

""In this plea agreement, Duke Energy Renewables acknowledges that it constructed these wind projects in a manner it knew beforehand would likely result in avian deaths,"" Robert G. Dreher, acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, said in a statement.

Duke has a market capitalization of nearly $50 billion.

""We deeply regret the impacts of golden eagles at two of our wind facilities,"" Greg Wolf, president of Duke Energy Renewables, said in a statement. ""Our goal is to provide the benefits of wind energy in the most environmentally responsible way possible.""

A study in September by federal biologists found that wind turbines had killed at least 67 bald and golden eagles since 2008. Wyoming had the most eagle deaths. That did not include deaths at Altamont Pass, an area in northern California where wind farms kill an estimated 60 eagles a year.",2014-05-04T05:48:27.471814,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'WY', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Natrona Co.', 'formattedAddress': 'Casper, WY', 'adminArea5': 'Casper'}, 'coords': [-106.313081, 42.866632]}",3zaM3k7MQ2GkUo70fn1Blg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-11-23T17:04:00.000Z,42825-643,ushahidi,Guilty pleas in bird deaths,"[{'name': 'Wildlife', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:30:40.539512,United States,WY,Natrona Co.,Casper,"Casper, WY",,,"{'adminArea3': 'WY', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Natrona Co.', 'formattedAddress': 'Casper, WY', 'adminArea5': 'Casper'}","[-106.313081, 42.866632]",42.866632,-106.313081,Wildlife,,,en

What we do know at this time is that blade debris was thrown an unknown distance from the turbine, and residents described the incident as “sounded like loud thunder” and “sounded like two trains crashing”. Witnesses also state that the incident shook their whole house, somewhat similar to an earthquake.

InvEnergy workers are on site and have cleaned the debris from the surrounding field, dragging it up to the base of the turbine.

A few days ago during the power outage on November 18, 2013 caused by strong storms, InvEnergy did not have had a plan for lighting the tower safety warning lights (not lit or flashing during power outages), or that plan miserably failed this time. The warning lights were inoperative from 5 PM till 9 PM. 

This power outage and subsequent failure of the warning light system could have resulted in airplanes not seeing the turbines and crashing in to them.

2014-05-09 19:29:21.529677,"The St. Clair Channel comprises three bodies of water -- the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and the Detroit River – which together make up the connecting channel between the Upper Great Lakes (Superior, Michigan and Huron) and the Lower Great Lakes (Erie and Ontario). 

The Channel also serves as the border between the U.S. and Canada. Therefore, this waterway serves as an important connecting commons between the two main parts of the Great Lakes, and between the two nations that border the Lakes. In this sense, the St. Clair Channel can be considered the heart of the Great Lakes. But there is another sense in which this phrase evokes the St. Clair Channel; that is, Lake St. Clair in the center of the Channel has the shape of a heart.

And this heart has become increasingly troubled over the years as industrial operations have come to dominate the shoreline of the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair has become contaminated with mercury and other toxins, and these waters flow into the Detroit River which then must carry the burden of pollutants from upstream combined with additional toxic wastes from plants in Detroit, Michigan, and Windsor, Ontario.

In my role as professor of sociology/anthropology at Earlham College in Richmond, IN, I took a group of students in my “Environmental Justice & Public Health” class on a field trip along the St. Clair Channel in early October, 2013.  

The links below take you to reports made by these students on the locations we visited. Together, these reports give a sense of how the St. Clair Channel Commons has been disrupted by industry that uses the water as a resource for cooling and disposal of toxic wastes. At the same time, they show how communities are joining together in efforts to fight back, seek answers to their questions, and explore creative ways of revitalizing the commons and the specific places they love in the very heart of the Great Lakes.

2014-05-09 19:30:40.448694,"A Mineral County businessman wants a federal judge to pull the plug on a controversial wind farm he says is thwarting his efforts to sell homebuyers on a proposed housing development less than two miles away from its turbines.
Mike Haywood of the Mike Haywood Group in Keyser says noise and vibrations from 23 Mitsubishi 2.4-megawatt turbines used at Pinnacle Wind are interfering with his ability to find buyers for his property. 
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Martinsburg, alleges low-frequency pulsations from the turbines, while always present, ""are at times more severely debilitating, causing core pulsations. At times these symptoms are so intense that (potential buyers) cannot escape the adverse effects ... without leaving their property."" 
It also claims higher frequency turbine noises ""depending upon the configuration of the blades and turbine are of such an intense and consistent sound or vibration as to cause annoyance, other mental and emotional disturbances and physical pain"" that potential buyers can't overlook. 
The suit suggests Pinnacle and its owners ""should have known that the same wind turbines had never been used around homes"" and to operate them without a buffering system or other design strategy in place was ""inappropriate, negligent and reckless.""
The wind farm, located at New Page, which is south of Keyser, has a 55.2-megawatt generating capacity with the capacity to power nearly 12,000 homes at the average West Virginia residential electricity use of about 1,200 kilowatt-hours/month.
The electricity generated by Pinnacle, however, is being sold in Maryland — about two-thirds of it powers Maryland's Department of General Services and the rest goes to the University of Maryland system.
The wind farm has been under fire since February, when Keyser resident Richard Braithwaite complained to the Public Service Commission of West Virginia that the turbine's rumblings made it difficult to eat or sleep, saying the noises were excessive and sound variously like ""a train coming through (your) yard"" or a ""large airplane circling (your) home"" and sunlight flickering through the moving blades were triggering migraines.
His complaint, however, was dismissed months later because the  PSC's own siting order didn't specifically prohibit noises, flickering light effects or other negative impacts from the turbines, ""so the commission does not possess statutory authority to address the issues raised by"" Braithwaite. (wow....what a copout!)
Haywood's suit is one of 32 filed against Pinnacle in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia within the past 60 days alleging the turbine noise and vibrations are impacting property values as well as people's mental and emotional well-being.

 Subject: Ocean Breeze Emu Farm-closing









Dear Friends,


It is with great sorrow that I write this e-mail.


Due to the abuse we are experiencing from the Industrial Wind Turbines our emus have suffered greatly. First with the installation of the test towers and the high pitch sounds emitting from them, we lost 26 of our 38 emus with no eggs laid. During the time the turbines were erected and the test towers were still in place; we lost 5 more emus. Leaving us 8 emus. The Agriculture in Truro reported to us that these birds had died of fear.


Three years after the turbines were up and running we finally had 7 eggs and 4 out of the seven survived, expanding our emu count to 11. A female emu will lay approximately 40 to 50 and we were accustom to incubating 100 per year in which half would hatch.


The next two years we had no eggs on the third year we had 52 eggs laid and 27 chicks hatched.


From the time the Industrial Wind Turbines were erected we here had NO meat or oil to sell–only the egg shells to generate any income from our emu farm.  Two years ago we put up a little shop selling polished beach stone jewellery and novelties, which Judy and Dave (Davey’s Mom and Dad) and I create. People come to see the emus and sometimes visit the shop. Unfortunately, this does not generate enough revenue to even begin to support our farm.


Over the past two years we have struggled to keep these 35 emus alive, but we could not keep their weight up…the agitation from the turbines caused them to run and run night and day wearing them down to practically nothing. The young ones suffered the most from the effects of the infrasound emitting from the turbines.


Emus habits are to lay down together at dusk–males and females pick their mates and the others huddle together for sleep.  We noticed that our emus were not laying down, but running through the night. We noticed that the birds were getting thinner and thinner. We contacted the feed company and they added more vitamins and fibre to the feed hoping that this would help, but unfortunately it did not. 


In the last two weeks we lost 5 our the younger emus. We have SEVEN of the 27 emus and SIX of the mature emus remaining; totalling 13 in all. We cannot prove that it is due to the effect of the turbines, but one thing we do know is that for the 18+ years before the turbines we NEVER had any problems with our birds, no unexplained deaths, no agitation they would lay down in the evening content and low us to sleep with their gentle drumming. We had healthy, productive, and content emus.


People would come literally from all over the world to visit our emus. Some from Sweden, Austria, Holland, London, all over United States and Canada, senior buses and tour buses have come to visit our Emu Farm and have been delighted in the antic and uniqueness of our emus. One of our emus “Ernie” was taken to Halifax to the Children’s Museum and appeared on the Breakfast TV show. 


These unique animals have not only supplied us with healthy meat, eggs, and oil, but have brought entertainment, joy and happiness to everyone who has had the opportunity to meet them…they will be truly missed.


So with great sadness, after 18+ years with our emu farm, Ocean Breeze Emu Farm will be closing. We would like to thank everyone who has supported us and may God Bless you.

-Massages can be short or long, depending on your needs that day (e.g. $5 for 5 minutes)

-If it proves not feasible during rush hour, the massages can be offered before and after to encourage people to travel outside of peak times and lighten the burden on transit infrastructure. Less crowded transit during rush hour makes everyone happier and less stressed.

-A culture of ""pay it forward"" will be encouraged, similar to at Tim Hortons, where people pay for someone behind you in on the subway.

-Such an  accessible and awesome amenity would encourage more people to take transit.

""There's the added humiliation of being tortured by men, and the women sometimes are forced to be nude,"" he said. ""There are cases of rape while in detention, and if she's not raped, she's probably been threatened with rape.""

The low-power Wi-Fi uses so little power that products can run for years on standard batteries. And the integrated stack, running on a secondary ""network"" processor, offloads WiFi services and networking functionalities from the host microcontroller. With this networking ability it is able to do something other companies can't — deliver a solution suitable for even the most processing and memory constrained MCUs. Customers can marry almost any 8-32-bit microcontroller to its solution and get Wi-Fi quickly, easily and at low cost. Nearly any device can now leverage the large installed base of Wi-Fi access points to connect to smartphones, the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure or to the Internet.

GainSpan's products address the market demand for low power and low cost Wi-Fi connectivity.

This rain garden involved directing rain gutter downspouts from the school's administrative building into the rain garden.  It also involved the excavation of the existing garden and placement of filter material at the base of the trench.  For the installation, SF volunteers worked alongside elementary school children, parents and community members to prep the rain garden with sand and amended soil, and plant native plants including Aeae (Hawaiian desert-thorn), Pohinahina (monk's pepper) and Akia.

The event engaged around 100 volunteers. With an annual average rainfall of 30 inches, the rain garden is estimated to capture roughly 70,000 gallons per year to put back into the island's aquifer.

2014-05-09 19:30:40.237919,"Property values around Boorowa will be detrimentally impacted by the construction and operation of wind turbines, according to a new, independent report.

Goulburn real estate consultant and registered valuer Peter Reardon found that the impact of wind turbine developments on rural property values can be as significant as a 60 percent decrease.

“The report has identified a detriment in property values. Discounts in value as identified of 33 percent and 60 percent in the market place cannot be ignored,” said Mr Reardon.

Boorowa District Landscape Guardians Chair, Charlie Arnott said the report is important to the region.

“The significance of this property value report cannot be underestimated by the Boorowa community. I suggest any landholder surrounding the proposed wind turbines in the district can expect the value of their properties to be reduced significantly right now, even though the projects are currently only at a proposal stage,” he said.

“If the Rugby, Bango and Rye Park wind turbine developments are built the best case scenario we can hope for would be an approximate $60 million reduction in value for the owners’ of surrounding properties, worst case could be closer to $100m, given the findings of this report,” Mr Reardon continued.

In the recent report, Mr Reardon said that neighbouring properties to wind turbine development are also impacted.

“The market evidence indicates that neighbouring properties to wind turbine development are being unfairly impacted upon, with little consideration by the development proponents on this particular stake holder. This raises issues not only from a loss of value and time delays in a sale circumstance, but can also negatively impact property owner equity and banking relationships,” he said.

Mr Reardon’s research includes discussions with real estate agents and owners in the Boorowa area.

“The vast majority of all real estate agencies surveyed believed that the location and proximity of wind turbines can have a significant impact upon the marketability of rural land holdings, especially in the form of buyer interest and extended sales period being required,” he said.

Rye Park property owner Jayne Apps has concerns having read the report.

“We bought this property in 1996 after living close to the Federal Highway at Goulburn. The stunning landscape and tranquillity of the property were a major part of the decision to move here and to now find that we may be surrounded by wind turbines is distressing. We may not be able to live with the visual impact, noise and disturbance of the turbines and would not expect anyone else to be able to either. This report confirms that I will not be able to sell the property for what it is worth and certainly will not be able to recoup my capital investment,” she said.

The report states that the impact on neighbouring properties is starting to be realised.

“The detrimental impact upon adjoining and/or nearby landholders appears to be beginning to be acknowledged by a number of wind turbine proponents. A notable example of this is developers in the Boorowa, Rugby region; we have information indicating that ‘Neighbouring Host Agreements’ or ‘Compensation Deeds’ have been agreed to and signed that compensate owners who have a residence within two kilometres distance of proposed future wind turbine developments, in a similar format to that being offered to those landholders who are prepared to host wind turbines and infrastructure on their land,” Mr Reardon said.

Mr Arnott said contracts requiring neighbours signatures are also a worry.

“What is of particular concern is that landholders have been approached to sign contracts consenting to the construction of industrial wind turbines within two kms of their homes,” he said.

“These people have believed the lies of the developers, are paid grossly inadequate compensation for their decision and will most likely have to abandon their homes if the turbines are ever built, given the growing body of evidence existing that the audible and inaudible noise generated by wind turbines can seriously impact human health,” Mr Arnott continued.

David White, from Rugby has been left devastated by the findings of the report.

“After seeking real estate value appraisals on my property, I have been informed that the value of my property will significantly drop due to this project. Some reports say 33-60 percent. I am absolutely outraged that my asset’s value will be destroyed,” he said.

Mr White said he bought into this area for a stress free life.

“But now it seems a nightmare awaits, not to mention that this will also cripple me financially. Personally the injustice I feel and to the surrounding neighbours in just unacceptable,” he continued.",2014-05-04T05:48:25.164809,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'NSW', 'adminArea1': 'Australia', 'adminArea5': 'Boorowa', 'streetAddress': 'Highway', 'postalCode': '2586', 'formattedAddress': 'Highway, Boorowa, NSW 2586'}, 'coords': [148.716805, -34.436553]}",zF17ST-9TDuUVwVOg90JXA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-11-09T08:42:00.000Z,42825-635,ushahidi,Loss of Property value in Australia,"[{'name': 'Loss of enjoyment', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Social disruption', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Reduced property values', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:30:40.237919,Australia,NSW,,Boorowa,"Highway, Boorowa, NSW 2586",2586,Highway,"{'adminArea3': 'NSW', 'adminArea1': 'Australia', 'adminArea5': 'Boorowa', 'streetAddress': 'Highway', 'postalCode': '2586', 'formattedAddress': 'Highway, Boorowa, NSW 2586'}","[148.716805, -34.436553]",-34.436553,148.716805,Loss of enjoyment,Social disruption,Reduced property values,en

Another of the thousands of wind turbines that now dot the Columbia Plateau has collapsed in a wind storm, this one at the Stateline wind farm near Touchet, Washington.

It’s a fairly rare event, but still raises questions about the longevity of region’s burgeoning wind fleet, whether turbines are being run within their operational tolerances and the environmental impact of such accidents, which typically result in the spill of hazardous chemicals. 

According to a story in the East Oregonian, the turbine was 10 years old, and the wind farm is operated by NextEra Energy Resources, which planned to clean up spilled fluid today.

A turbine collapse at the Klondike III wind farm in Oregon killed a man in 2007.

Today, massive banana plantations occupy the agricultural lands where these Hondurans once lived. Consequentially, the residents of Buena Vista are constrained to the only water source that is high in “sarro” (calcium carbonate) and other contaminants that result in various health problems. 

The individual households received water via makeshift rubber and PVC tubing strung above the ground, allowing for susceptibility to tears and bursts, especially during the wet season. We have
designed a gravity-fed water filtration and distribution system that provides potable water to a community of approximately 45 families. In the last couple years significant progress was achieved, finishing the construction of the storage and break pressure tanks and installation of 60 percent of the distribution pipeline. With the convenience of a clean water source in every household, the villagers have gained access to clean water for drinking, bathing, and laundry. A clean, reliable water source has the potential to improve the lives of the villagers, the majority of whom are subsistence farmers.

2014-05-09 19:31:46.997420,"Abra Malagá Thastayoc is a rural Andean community consisting of Quechua-speaking inhabitants practicing self-sufficient agriculture, pastoralism and traditional weaving techniques. This community lacks a connection to the electrical grid and there is little chance of this happening in the future. Most local households do not have lighting, and community members must travel long distances to charge basic electrical devices. This project aims to provide accessible sources of electricity to twenty households in Abra Malagá Thastayoc through the installation of pico-hydroelectric generators and solar panels.

This project is a collaborative effort between Cusco-based Asociación Ecosistemas Andinos (ECOAN), engineering students from SUNY-ESF, and Sam Redfield, the inventor of the pico-hydroelectric generator. ECOAN has longstanding ties with the community of Abra Malagá Thastayoc and will coordinate work within the community. Student engineers and Mr. Redfield are working on the technical design and the engineering students will be responsible for financing the bulk of the project. Both organizations and Mr. Redfield will participate in the physical implementation process along with local community members. 

Abra Malagá Thastayoc consists of approximately 32 households, 20 of which lack access to electricity. ECOAN has installed solar panels in 12 houses, the local school, and the community meeting house over the past five years. This project intends to provide electricity for the rest of the village by the end of 2013 through small-scale hydroelectric systems known as “pico-hydroelectric generators” and solar panels in locations without a suitable source of water. 

The pico-hydroelectric generator was designed by Sam Redfield with the Appropriate Infrastructure and Development Group (AIDG) and is built using a modified Toyota alternator (one of the most common in the world) and widely available PVC materials. These generators provide a cost-effective and accessible source of electricity that can be easily replicated, repaired and upgraded to increase capacity.

Pico-hydroelectric generators will be installed within clusters of houses near suitable water sources. They will operate as remote charging stations where local families can charge batteries to power LED lamps, radios, and cell phones. Each proposed generator location would serve 3-4 households (most shared within families) that are within easy walking distance. Solar panels will be installed in the remaining houses that are widely dispersed and located far from appropriately-sized rivers.

The initial plan of action for this project calls for building four pico-hydroelectric generators to serve 13 households and installing seven household solar panel systems. The first implementation phase will be the construction of two generators sometime between February and April, 2013. These pilot systems will be monitored throughout the spring months to ensure they are functioning properly and meeting local needs. SUNY-ESF sent a team in summer 2013 to test system functionality during the dry season. If the pilot generators prove to be effective, the team will install two more generators and oversee the installation of prefabricated solar panel systems. Project completion before post implementation assessment is envisioned for the end of 2013 to the beginning of 2014. 

A main benefit of the pico-hydroelectric generators is that they can be built and repaired using readily accessible materials and tools. This accessibility will allow local people to take responsibility and ownership of providing electricity within their community through a community-based installation program and a self-sustaining maintenance strategy.

ECOAN and SUNY-ESF will work with local community members to develop a maintenance plan that will help ensure that the project will work towards self-sufficiency in the future. Preliminary ideas include forming an energy cooperative, micro-enterprise strategies, charging households small initial and annual fees to cover future repair costs, and training a small group of local residents so they can diagnose and repair generator malfunctions. The final maintenance strategy will be decided on following community discussions and workshops in the first half of 2013.

After completion, this project can serve as a case study in the world of science and engineering and teach others the impact that electricity has in improving lives in the developing world. The project will also demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing hydropower through the use of a pico-hydro generator to produce electricity. With this electricity, the community will have the ability to charge their cell phones, radios, and lights and in turn will be able to save the money that they were previously spending to travel to the closest town in search for electricity. The saved money can be utilized to improve their lives by investing in a larger crop or improving their homes. 

In an educational standpoint, students will be able to gain experience working internationally as well as working with technology by being involved in this project. They will learn how to construct a solar array and a pico-hydro generator and will improve upon their communication skills when working on reports for the project. 

Upon arrival in the community, students will be instructing the community members how the electrical energy is produced and how the systems function. This is a vital component of the project and is the main focus of our impact on the community. When the families we are helping become educated, they have the ability to pass on their knowledge to others and increase our influence greater than we can imagine. This also allows for financial gain of the community. They can become skilled in the construction of the system and can become a paid expert to install our plan in places similar to their own.",2014-05-04T06:09:01.385190,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'Cuzco', 'adminArea1': 'Peru', 'adminArea4': 'La Convención Province', 'formattedAddress': 'Huayopata, Peru', 'adminArea5': 'Huayopata'}, 'coords': [-72.303889, -13.135]}",W5o3stPASSyTnmIxC2DHCA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-11-09T02:23:00.000Z,49477-96,ushahidi,SUNY-ESF: Alternative Energy in the Andean Highlands,"[{'name': 'Partnerships', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Environment', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Fundraising', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Other', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:31:46.997420,Peru,Cuzco,La Convención Province,Huayopata,"Huayopata, Peru",,,"{'adminArea3': 'Cuzco', 'adminArea1': 'Peru', 'adminArea4': 'La Convención Province', 'formattedAddress': 'Huayopata, Peru', 'adminArea5': 'Huayopata'}","[-72.303889, -13.135]",-13.135,-72.303889,Partnerships,Environment,Fundraising,en

Wind turbines killed hundreds of thousands of bats in 2012 in the United States, according to an article by Mark Hayes of the University of Colorado. Hayes took the number of dead bats from 21 wind turbine locations and inferred the number of nationwide bat deaths, arriving at the conservative estimate of 600,000 bats killed in 2012. But the real toll, Hayes notes, may be as high as 900,000.   

Bats are killed by collisions with wind turbine blades or from air pressure changes caused by the blades, the latter being the real danger. Similar to the bends in scuba divers, barotrauma causes bats to pop from the inside.

“There are bats with no broken bones or other evidence of blunt trauma, that have pulmonary and middle ear hemorrhages which implies that they had suffered barotrauma,” Melissa Behr, a vet at the University of Wisconsin told the Telegraph in September (Behr wasn’t involved in Hayes’s research). “In one case 46 percent of the bats that were seen had no physical sign of trauma, but 100 percent had pulmonary hemorrhage.”

Because bat populations are also under threat from climate change and white-nose syndrome (a fungal infection that has killed millions of bats since 2007), and because most bats only give birth to one young per year, Hayes says the addition of wind turbines to the bat-killing mix is worrisome. Although few people have a love for bats, they’re the primary consumers of insects in some regions. Bats are particularly beneficial to farmers, who spend billions of dollars a year on insect suppression services, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Fewer bats means more insects and higher pest-control bills. 

It isn’t just bats wind turbines are killing in large numbers. In a study published earlier this year in the Wildlife Society Bulletin, author K. Shawn Smallwood estimated that 573,000 birds were killed by U.S. wind turbines (as well as 888,000 bats). In another 2013 study, published in the Journal of Raptor Research, biologists from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that wind turbines have killed 67 golden and bald eagles in the last five years.

CHANDLER TOWNSHIP — A wind turbine blade broke at DTE Energy’s new Echo Wind Park near Caseville sometime before 8:30 a.m. Friday.

Part of the turbine blade was on the ground below the structure at noon Friday as DTE Energy’s Dennis Buda was at the turbine checking for safety concerns. DTE stopped other the wind turbines at Echo Wind Park because of concerns after the blade failure. 

“My husband said look out the bathroom room window this morning to see it,” said Tracey Powell, who lives about a half mile from the broken turbine. “The DTE guys started getting there around 8:30 a.m.”

Powell said that the broken blade didn’t worry her much.

“They got their work cut out for them, that’s all,” she said. “I’m not a fan of the windmills but they’re here to stay. We got live with them — they’re safe enough away.”

Winds were blowing at 10-15 mph in the area during the past 24 hours according to the National Weather Service. 

DTE Energy spokesman Scott Simons said that the incident was under investigation Friday morning.

“There were no injuries and no property damage other than the turbine itself,” Simons said.

It was the third turbine to break in Huron County in the last 10 months and the second turbine owned by DTE to break down in that time. In March, a turbine blade in Sigel Township broke because of a manufacturing defect, said turbine supplier General Electric, according to a presentation by Buda at a Huron County Planning Commission meeting last month.

In addition, a turbine was struck by lightning near Minden City at the Michigan Wind Project 2 in September. The turbine, owned by Exelon Energy also lost a blade and was set to be back online this week.

“Well, I would have said that this was a rare occurrence before the first one,” Simons said when asked how often a blade fails. “We want to get to the root cause of this.”

The Echo Wind Park was approved in November 2012 and was set to be completed by the end of this month, according to DTE program manager Michael Serafin. At the Huron County Planning Commission meeting Wednesday, Serafin said that 50 out of the 70 wind turbines at the site were up and running.

Buda said that part of the blade debris was removed Friday. The turbine is on North Farver Road near the intersection of Dunn Road.",2014-05-04T05:48:44.751662,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'MI', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Huron Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Bad Axe', 'streetAddress': '4467 Kipper Rd', 'postalCode': '48413', 'formattedAddress': '4467 Kipper Rd, Bad Axe, MI 48413'}, 'coords': [-82.842522, 43.814999]}",JW_IhyjrTFGKl8hGGpynhQ,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-11-08T17:00:00.000Z,42825-632,ushahidi,Another turbine blade breaks in Huron County,"[{'name': 'Blade throw', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:30:42.166642,United States,MI,Huron Co.,Bad Axe,"4467 Kipper Rd, Bad Axe, MI 48413",48413,4467 Kipper Rd,"{'adminArea3': 'MI', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Huron Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Bad Axe', 'streetAddress': '4467 Kipper Rd', 'postalCode': '48413', 'formattedAddress': '4467 Kipper Rd, Bad Axe, MI 48413'}","[-82.842522, 43.814999]",43.814999,-82.842522,Blade throw,,,en

2014-05-09 19:29:22.678879,"On October 2, 2013, I traveled with fellow students in my Sociology and Anthropology class from Earlham College in Richmond, IN, to Sarnia, Ontario, Marine City, and Southwest Detriot, MI, to explore patterns of environmental justice, particularly around pollution from chemical plants. The following is a summary of our class’s experience in Marine City and my personal reflection:

Marine City, in St. Clair County, MI, lies downriver of Chemical Valley, an industrial complex of 62 petrochemical plants in Sarnia, Ontario. Like many other cities in Michigan, Marine City draws its water from the St. Clair river. Spills from the chemical plants, however, are not promptly and consistently reported to authorities and residents, particularly on the US side of the border. 

On October 2, our class met with five Marine City community leaders working towards minimizing the risk of water contamination through better monitoring of chemical compounds in the water and better reporting. Danielle Williams, Kristina Tranchemontagne and Valerie Benson (mom) are the founders of Mothers Against Childhood Cancer (MACC), a group that formed after 5 Marine City children were diagnosed with Wilms Tumor, a rare kidney disease present in young children. Both Danielle and Kristina’s daughters were diagnosed with Wilms Tumor. 

MACC is currently working on identifying the chemicals present in the St. Clair river. One challenge they are facing is that the number of water-testing plants has decreased from 13 to 9. Luckily, they have been able to forge a partnership with the St. Clair Community College to make use of their mass spectrometer, a standard technology for identifying chemical compounds, even in very small amounts. 

Although the children in St. Clair County who were diagnosed with Wilms Tumor have since recovered, the cause of the increase in incidence of Wilms Tumor is yet to be clarified. Hopefully, through better monitoring of water quality more evidence can be produced to place pressure on chemical companies to update their safety measures. 

In February 2013 the St. Clair County Health Department published the report from their investigative study into the Wilms Tumor issue in St. Clair County. Although not officially designed a cancer cluster, Wilms Tumor incidence in St. Clair County is above normal incidence rate (48.4 cases per million children as opposed to 18 cases per million children, in 2000-2009). 

The MACC members we met expressed many frustrations with that report, which attempted to pin much of the cause of Wilms Tumor on lifestyle choices of the mother and to reduce the link between environmental exposures and Wilms Tumor. Although the report reiterated the Health Department’s concern for monitoring environmental health hazards, since their study was published little has been done to shed light on the preventable causes of Wilms Tumor.",2014-05-04T05:33:47.598121,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'MI', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'St. Clair Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Marine City', 'streetAddress': '108 S Main St', 'postalCode': '48039', 'formattedAddress': '108 S Main St, Marine City, MI 48039'}, 'coords': [-82.492132, 42.719478]}",4OFL9HW1QEWRg_WMTqkGOg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-11-06T13:00:00.000Z,36776-155,ushahidi,Families Fighting Cancer on the St. Clair River,"[{'name': 'Healing', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Stories & Places', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:29:22.678879,United States,MI,St. Clair Co.,Marine City,"108 S Main St, Marine City, MI 48039",48039,108 S Main St,"{'adminArea3': 'MI', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'St. Clair Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Marine City', 'streetAddress': '108 S Main St', 'postalCode': '48039', 'formattedAddress': '108 S Main St, Marine City, MI 48039'}","[-82.492132, 42.719478]",42.719478,-82.492132,Healing,Stories & Places,,en

2014-05-09 19:10:00.406704,"there was a website with info on candidates for elections.  Then everyone would know who to vote for in the Toronto 2014 election.

Over the last 3 Toronto municipal elections, voter turnout has ranged from 38% to 53%. This low turnout has led many Torontonians to be misrepresented by their political leaders. Furthermore it is becoming increasingly difficult to gain quality and unbiased information about the candidates running in your area.

In an effort to solve these problems I am creating a website to inform voters on the types of issues facing city council and which candidates they would be best represented by. The City of Toronto makes all of the city council voting records available to the public. The website will use these records to allow visitors to vote on the same issues their councillors voted on and see which councillors share their views and opinions.

Although this website is still in the early stages of design I have started created a preliminary prototype to show what the site might look like. The prototype is available at: http://pollcat-toronto.herokuapp.com/

The first prototype should be finished in mid-December at which point I will be recruiting other web developers to contribute to this open source project.

2014-05-09 19:29:21.704538,"Below is an account of my visit to the Aamjiwnaang cemetery.

This piece is a part of a Sociology/Anthropology class at Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana.

***

We moved quietly and carefully as we stepped onto the pavement because the ground is sacred, filled with the bones of their ancestors. It has been said that some of these bones have been carbon dated to be over 5000 years old. 

It is interesting that sometimes a statement like that can be hard to comprehend, a time so unfathomably long ago, the significance and importance blows right over our heads without being truly understood. But here in this ancient cemetery, you can feel it. 

Among the scattered headstones, benches and flowers, you can feel a deep rooted stillness: an ancient presence that is so lacking in much of the world today that sometimes we have forgotten what it feels like.
 
However, like so much of Aamjiwnaang land, this silence and indescribable presence is broken by the dull hum of industry. Flanked on each side and barley separated by a thin chain link fence lie two major petrochemical corporations busily creating revenue in the background.
 
Our guide began to tell us the story of the Suncor short stack located on the perimeter of this ancient cemetery to our right. In 2010, expansion started on one of Suncor's largest ethanol refineries, despite local protest. While the goal of the plant was to remove sulfur from diesel fuel, an act deemed environmentally beneficial, the process was detrimental to the surrounding area including the cemetery. In particular, a sulfur burning stack located directly on the perimeter of the cemetery was built much lower than legal safety standards resulting in a highly toxic sulfuric rain that dispersed in the surrounding area. 

Through local legal action and work with Ecojustice, the community was able to sue Suncor for $200,000 to $300,000 for their actions which were causing unnecessary harm to locals as well as the environment. They also managed to get an agreement with Suncor to rebuild this particular stack according to health and safety codes. However, Suncor was later given a direct order to ramp production back up to 100% without fixing the height of the short stack. The stack burned slowly in the distance as our guide talked, and it was evident that no progress on its reconstruction had been attempted since that lawsuit over 3 years ago.
 
The presence of industry in this setting illustrates the undeniable challenges that the Aamjiwnaang people have had with the pressure of industrialization. Since the first refining factory arrived in Sarnia over 150 years ago, cultural and economic complexities have infiltrated a traditional way of life. Our guide continues to speak, exactly on this train of thought. ""Look around you"" he says. ""As we speak, three surveillance cameras are watching our every move from these facilities"". He explains that this is where they bury the dead. They have traditional rituals to uphold and funeral rights to perform for the passing of their tribal members. Not only are the cameras watching them, giving the dead no peace, but our guide recounts an instance when workers mocked and mimicked their practices just beyond the fence during a funeral procession.
 
This, among many of the other stories our guide told us on our tour, moved me beyond words. At that moment all I could feel was the injustice bestowed on this community and anger towards the systems in which this was allowed to happen. But who is to blame? How can we appropriately address situations like this to keep them from repeating themselves? When looking at the whole picture, the cultural and economic complexities of the situation tends to blur the line of action. We are a part of, yet separated from, this system that drives these injustices, and no matter how much people say or do to fight them, these inhumane situations keep happening. Personally I was left with a deep disappointment for humanity. I simply cannot understand how people can be that cruel to one another and how these corporations seem to purposefully harm others for profit. How can they feel justified in their actions? And if the power lies in the hands of these corporations, is there any hope for the future?
 
But I have also noticed that when one zooms in rather than looking at the whole picture, when one reads, watches, listens, or shares a lived experience of environmental, cultural, or political injustice, the reactions are very much the same in all people. It is hard not to have an emotional reaction to something as poignant as the Aamjiwnaang cemetery next to Suncor's short stack and not see that something is wrong. It is simple, clear, and undeniable.",2014-05-04T05:33:34.912594,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Lambton', 'adminArea5': 'Sarnia', 'postalCode': 'N7T', 'formattedAddress': 'Sarnia, ON N7T, Canada'}, 'coords': [-82.433326, 42.929587]}",FuAq2IGHSUOPlmTkT3SIEQ,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-11-01T13:05:00.000Z,36776-158,ushahidi,Aamjiwnaang Cemetery,"[{'name': 'Harming (General)', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Stories & Places', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:29:21.704538,Canada,ON,Lambton,Sarnia,"Sarnia, ON N7T, Canada",N7T,,"{'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Lambton', 'adminArea5': 'Sarnia', 'postalCode': 'N7T', 'formattedAddress': 'Sarnia, ON N7T, Canada'}","[-82.433326, 42.929587]",42.929587,-82.433326,Harming (General),Stories & Places,,en

2014-05-09 19:29:22.769417,"Below are some thoughts on Talfourd Creek in the Fist Nation of Aamjiwnaang.

This piece is part of a Sociology/Anthropology class at Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana.

***

Having the opportunity to visit a portion of Talfourd creek was a very powerful experience. Talfourd creek used to be a source of life for the people of Aamjiwnaang First Nation Reserve near Sarnia. Children used to play in the water. People used to fish and swim in the creek. From what I understand, Talfourd creek was a beautiful, life sustaining body of water.

The Talfourd creek that my classmates and I saw was nothing like this. Before approaching the creek we were greeted by a sign warning “KEEP OUT”. The skull and crossbones on the sign informed us that Talfourd creek contains toxic substances known to cause serious health risks. Standing there with Ron Plain, an environmental activist member of the First Nations Reserve of Aamjiwnaang who led us on a toxic tour, we learned about how beautiful the creek used to be, and what it has become. Hearing Ron’s story was very powerful. The emotion was palpable. “How do you keep a kid out of water?” he asked us.

I don’t know the answer to that question. But I do know that nowadays Talfourd creek does not support life.  The waters are brown and polluted. The surrounding industry has made Talfourd creek lifeless. It can no longer provide fish. It can longer provide a space for children to swim and play. Talfourd creek has been taken away from the people of Aamjiwnaang. 

Residents of the Reserve have witnessed trucks dumping unknown substances into the creek. The incentive to maximize profit is what killed Talfourd creek. The greed of a few is what has robbed Talfourd creek from the many. 

Talfourd creek is just one example of the uncountable externalities of Sarnia’s chemical valley. What makes the story of Talfourd creek so powerful is the fact that you can see it. Right there in front of us were the visible effects of industrial pollution, but all around us were the less visible effects that are all the more tragic. 

The tragedy of Talfourd creek is a tragedy of the loss of a life source, the loss a cultural and social resource. It is the loss of a food source, the loss of a playground, the loss of a habitat, the loss of a familiar space that has existed for generations. The contamination of Talfourd creek is much more than just the loss of a body of water. It is also the contamination of a way of life.",2014-05-04T05:33:45.303053,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Lambton', 'adminArea5': 'Sarnia', 'streetAddress': 'Gibson St & Talfourd St', 'postalCode': 'N7T', 'formattedAddress': 'Gibson St & Talfourd St, Sarnia, ON N7T, Canada'}, 'coords': [-82.390631, 42.966422]}",oVu_hyGISQqBf9O-YbBmBg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-10-30T13:24:00.000Z,36776-151,ushahidi,Talfourd Creek: Keep Out,"[{'name': 'Harming (General)', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Stories & Places', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:29:22.769417,Canada,ON,Lambton,Sarnia,"Gibson St & Talfourd St, Sarnia, ON N7T, Canada",N7T,Gibson St & Talfourd St,"{'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Lambton', 'adminArea5': 'Sarnia', 'streetAddress': 'Gibson St & Talfourd St', 'postalCode': 'N7T', 'formattedAddress': 'Gibson St & Talfourd St, Sarnia, ON N7T, Canada'}","[-82.390631, 42.966422]",42.966422,-82.390631,Harming (General),Stories & Places,,en

The southwest region of Detroit is the most polluted area in the state of Michigan, and the third most polluted area in the United States. This specific area is designated by the zip codes 48217 and 48218. 

The residents living here are extremely economically disadvantaged and predominantly African-American. Southwest Detroit suffers from air, water, and soil contamination due to the conglomeration of oil, steel, and other production plants. 

Throughout the previous fifteen years, the number of residents in the area has decreased drastically due to the pollution from these facilities.

Companies: Private and Public Facilities along Detroit River
Marathon (oil refinery)

3 steel companies: (including) Severstal Steel and Great Lakes Steel
- Ajacks Paving, Detroit Paving Company
- Detroit Wastewater Treatment Plant
- Detroit Salt Plant

Pollution coming from trucks on Interstate 75 
Residents who live alongside the facilities often complain about toxic smells, fumes from the sewers, and toxic waste water flooding the streets. Living near this industrial area has increased the risk of poisoning from neighboring facilities and diesel pollution from the highway just above these communities. 

Neighborhoods are surrounded and residents suffer from upper respiratory problems, learning disabilities, and a variety of cancers. House-owners claim that their home values aren't high enough to get tax breaks. The ""Hole"" is a community on the corner of Liebold St, Pleasant St, and Midsale St, and I-75 runs directly over it. 

Originally a wetland and home for auto workers, the Hole was a family neighborhood until Marathon moved next door. All families in this community have been evacuated except for one, Adrian Crawford. Her home has a constant stream of trucks driving down the road, past her home. Adrian went to complain to the City Council, but was told that her home didn’t exist. They then agreed that something had to be done about her situation, but nothing did actually ever happen. Adrian asks, “Why should I have to move because of a situation I didn’t do myself?” 

Located not too far from “the Hole” is a neighborhood called Oakwood Heights. Though this area was once inhabited, the majority of the homes lay vacant, many demolished. When the Marathon Petroleum Company moved its business into this area they offered homeowners buyout packages through a program called the Oakwood Heights Property Purchase Program. Marathon is currently working on refurbishing the lots into grassy areas, with signs reading “No Trespassing” and “this area under surveillance.”

The community has been mobilized to protest through the Sierra Club, and its staff member Rhonda Anderson. She had helped to facilitate an action called the “Bucket Brigade” with residents of the area. The Brigade takes indoor/outdoor air samples and has them tested. Anderson has helped to take samples from Adrian Crawford’s basement and send them into a testing facility in California. After testing the samples, the facility immediately contacted Crawford and advised her to leave her house as soon as possible. But for Crawford, who can remember how proud her mom was of their family home, moving is not an option.

2014-05-09 19:29:21.801505,"I am posting in conjunction with several other students from Earlham College in Richmond Indiana. We are in a research class about environmental justice and public health with a section focusing on the great Lakes area. 

***

On October 2, 2013, we took a trip to Sarnia, Ontario with a class from our college in Indiana.  In Sarnia, we had the chance to meet an incredible man named Ron Plain.  Ron is Aanishinaabe and a band member of the Aamjiwnaang Reserve. Ron no longer lives on the reserve - he moved his family into downtown Sarnia several years ago out of fear for his children’s health.  

You see, Aamjiwnaang is bordered on three sides by a jungle of petrochemical industry known as Chemical Valley, and its 800 residents are suffering the health effects of living with polluted water and air.  

As Ron gave our group a ""Toxic Tour"" of chemical valley and his home, we got to hear some of his personal story.  Ron has been fighting for his people’s rights to clean air, clean water, and regulatory transparency for years. In November 2010, along with friend a fellow band member Ada Lockridge, he embarked on a long legal journey by filing an Application for Judicial Review against Suncor Corporation and the government of Ontario. 

Their defense in this case is sponsored by Ecojustice, a charitable organization of lawyers and scientists that provides free support to Canadian citizens fighting for environmental justice. Ecojustice staff lawyers Justin Duncan and Margot Venton and senior scientist Dr. Elaine MacDonald serve as their legal support.

This case began when Suncor announced plans to build Canada’s largest ethanol plant directly across the road from the Aamjiwnaang band office - an announcement that Ron now considers to have been merely a distraction technique. He doesn't think Suncor had any plans for an ethanol plant, but while Ron and fellow activists' attention was focused on that proposal, Suncor proceeded to build a desulfurization plant right next to the Aamjiwnaang cemetery, a sacred ancestral First Nations burial site dating back over 10,000 years. 

Removing sulfur from diesel fuel might sound environmentally beneficial, but the emissions stack on this plant was built much lower than the legal minimum height.  That means that the sulfur emissions rain directly over Aamjiwnaang and settle there, rather than dispersing over a wider area as would be the case if the stack’s height met the legal requirements.

When the Ontario Ministry of Environment (MOE) discovered the faulty stack, Suncor was very publicly ordered to reduce the desulfurization process to pollution standards and fined $200,000 to $300,000. This demonstrated an acknowledgment of harm to human health on the part of the MOE. Suncor was later given permission, in the form of a private, government-issued director’s order, to ramp production back up to 100%. Aamjiwnaang band leaders supported this act without obtaining consent form community members. It was this action – the MOE’s direct permission for Suncor to continue something that had been acknowledged as harmful to the health of the people of Aamjiwnaang – that prompted Ron and Ada to file a lawsuit.

In their Charter challenge, Ron, Ada, and Ecojustice are attempting to do something that has never been done before, and for that they have received international attention. In the unprecedented claim they are making Ron, Ada, and their partners at Ecojustice believe that it is a basic human right to walk outside one’s home and not breathe air that is harmful to health. This claim, which is indeed monumental in the context of Canadian law, could be a step toward Canada approving a constitutional amendment for the right to a healthy environment, as 90 other countries around the world have done over the past 40 years.

2014-05-09 19:29:23.203478,"Below is a short poem about my visit to Liebold Street in South West Detroit. 

This piece is a part of a Sociology/Anthropology class at Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana.

***

Liebold Street: Just below the Overpass

Just below the overpass
A sacrificial street
Another externality 
A smell that’s not discreet

Don’t they give some thought
To the lives affected here?
Maybe they ignore the guilt
And hope they disappear

I know that with this progress
That some are left behind 
There’s profit in those trucks
And oil unrefined

Just below the overpass
There are cars beneath the soot
Liquids seeping through the ground
There’s industry afoot

My head now starts to ache
And my nose it starts to run
I’ve been here just 5 minutes
Our visit’s just begun 

Standing watching trucks go by
The sign remains unread
We are being watched as well
From cameras overhead

Just below the overpass
A community’s neglected 
Profit over human life
Was this really unexpected?

Just below the overpass
The lesson of our time
Who protects these people
Is this not a crime?

Just below the overpass
People slowly die
A neighborhood expendable
What does this imply?

Just below the overpass
It’s really time for change
But right now we’re dependent
On the stock exchange

Just below the overpass
Signs the system failed
Just below the overpass

We all post reports of the same, some worse than others their chemicals contain, who but the few know how to negate that which by mere unknowing men, could never hope to know or understand; much less stop just by our observations, knowing that for most of us, that is about all one can do as their part to play being within the All.

In Michael Vickerman’s recent opinion piece (“Wind power is safe, affordable and good for the economy,” Oct. 15), he and others who work for Renew Wiscosnsin would like you to believe that industrial wind turbines are the best thing since sliced bread and that there are no problems with placing them less than 1,000 feet from people’s homes. He is trying to mislead you.

Industrial Wind turbines are affecting the quality of my life. My physician wrote a letter with the suggestion I take it to the Fond du Lac County Board of Health regarding how the wind turbines surrounding my home have had a detrimental effect on my health.

Unfortunately, I am far from alone. So far, 25 certified affidavits from residents in every wind project in our county have been sent to Kim Mueller, our county health officer. Vickerman and RENEW are well aware that there was a recent unanimous vote by the FDL County’s Board of Health along with a unanimous vote by the County Board of Supervisors both asking the state to step in and do an independent comprehensive health study on the problems many of us are having. The number one complaint is sleep disturbance. The body cannot be restored each day without restful sleep.

The middle of the night is by far the worst for the noise and vibration these monsters can make. If the wind direction puts our home in the blow-back area of a turbine, the walls and windows will literally shake. One of the wind turbines is less than 1000 feet from the foundation of our home with one of our bedroom windows facing it; we caulked that window shut five years ago.

The developers of these industrial wind projects were given rules and regulations on noise levels to abide by, but neither the PSC nor other state officials are enforcing these rules.

2014-05-09 19:30:42.427220,"The 315-megawatt Ocotillo Express Wind project in Imperial County is shut down today after a 10-ton blade came loose from one of the project's 112 wind turbines, landing about 100 yards away on a public road. The accident took place one day after San Diego County loosened restrictions on siting large wind turbines near residential areas.

""It looks as though the blade came off while the tip was pointed at the ground, and then tumbled,"" Ocotillo resident Parke Ewing told ReWire. ""I'd say the end of the blade that had been connected to the rotor landed about a football field's length away from the turbine it came off of.""

According to a press release put out Thursday by local opponents of the wind project, the blade came to rest on a publicly accessible jeep trail passing through land managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

""My grandchildren are out there all the time,"" said Ewing. ""We're all just incredibly lucky that no one was killed.""

Pattern Energy spokesperson Matt Dallas told ReWire that inspectors from turbine manufacturer Siemens were on site Thursday morning gathering information on the incident. We'll share that information with you as we receive it. 

A press release from the local Protect Our Communities Foundation pointed out an irony in the accident's timing. ""This wholly avoidable public health and safety hazard occurred just one day after San Diego County Board of Supervisors approved the revised Wind Energy Ordinance & Boulevard Community Plan to remove community protections to allow 500 foot tall industrial wind turbines on private land in previously protected areas near homes, recreation areas, and sensitive wildlife -- just like the BLM did for Pattern Energy's Ocotillo Wind,"" said the release.

Documented instances of blade throw with comparable wind turbines show that blades can actually travel about twice as far as Parke estimated for Thursday's incident. That's a sobering thought for travelers on Interstate 8 past Ocotillo, with turbines well within that throw distance of the freeway, as well as on Interstate 10 through North Palm Springs where similarly closely placed turbines line the roadway.

2014-05-09 19:30:43.100429,"Wind turbine noise is hard to live with

Sun, 10/20/2013 - 7:00am | The News-Gazette 
 

I live in Invenergy's California Ridge Wind Farm near Armstrong. To educate people about turbine noise, let me offer firsthand information.

The wind speed, time of day — night being the loudest — plus rotation speed of the turbine blades combine to produce a disruptive noise level.



When the turbine blade takes four seconds to make a rotation the loudest noise is produced, including low frequency noise generating a humming, droning sound.

In contrast, if the rotation takes five to six seconds, the noise level drops. To measure rotation speed, count the seconds it takes for the tip of the blade to make a complete 360 degree revolution.

When investigating, do not make the mistake of driving under the turbine to listen as the noise is produced from above and heard peripherally.

Low frequency noise can affect people differently — like fingernails on a chalkboard. This may not bother one person, but it may negatively impact another. When turbines are at their noisiest, it is like experiencing motion sickness and/or a feeling of anxiety.

Contrary to what Invenergy's lawyer, Mike Blazer, said in a recent News-Gazette article, I am pleased with the local sound specialist. Blazer indicated I was ""not comfortable"" with this person.

This is untrue. In fact, I contacted the same sound specialist requesting a study. However, he was under contract with Invenergy, creating a conflict of interest.

I hope this answers some readers' questions. Readers who have more can call me. I'm in the phone book.

2014-05-09 19:29:22.858200,"I was on a bike ride a couple of weeks ago (early October) riding the path all the up Humber River. It's a wonderful trail, and we're lucky to have it, especially on a beautiful day as it was. 

Just south of Finch and Islington I rounded a bend and slammed on the brakes. There, about 30 yards ahead, crossing right across the path, were three deer. Two large (surprisingly so), and a smaller one. We all stopped and stared at each for a bit, then they wandered slowly off along their way, along a narrow trail through the woods. 

it was a beautiful reminder of how we are all so closely connected to nature through water.

I think it's amazing that one of the most majestic natural features on Earth is almost literally right outside our door, within reach of so many people. My bike rides are often along the ravines or the lake. And a walk along the lake - in any season - gives you a feeling like no other. 

On a deeper level, they're a link to a distant past, from when they were formed by the last ice age, through the thousands of seasons, and migrations of animals and birds and people, up to today, when somehow they still manage to impress us despite how shabbily we treat them. 

We need to stop thinking of the environment as something separate, like just another section of the paper like sports or business. There is only the environment, and everything is the environment. We end up drinking whatever we pour down the drain, and living beside the Great Lakes ought to be a daily reminder of how we need to look after nature.

2014-05-09 19:31:47.191896,"Zimbabwe Educational Trust is a small charity based in Leeds, working to support Zimbabwean communities in their efforts to keep children in school and out of poverty. We have been operating for over 25 years and the impact of our work was recently recognised by the Zimbabwe Achievers Awards, who presented ZET’s Director with the award for ‘Lifetime Outstanding Contribution’ at a ceremony in 2012. 

Vuli Mkandla, the founder of our charity. Vuli is a great man who has changed the lives of thousands of people through helping to provide education to those in Zimbabwe. Between 1987 and 2004, he was responsible for sending over 1,000 Zimbabweans to the UK for higher education, and current projects include sending used computers to schools in Zimbabwe and helping orphans gain orphan legal status. All in all, Vuli is a great man and we are trying to make this night a great success. to support the running cost of ZET’s operations in the UK. 

In the context of the HIV/AIDS crisis and the resultantly high levels of orphanhood in Zimbabwe, birth certificates – which are required to enrol in school – have become increasingly important in the fight to keep children in education. Cultural, economic, and bureaucratic factors combine to prevent almost a third of all Zimbabwean children from accessing birth certificates, thereby excluding them from formal education.

Despite these problems, very few organisations focus on identity documents as a means to promote development; where such issues are dealt with, they are done so on a purely reactive basis. In conjunction with our project delivery partner in Bulawayo, ZET takes a uniquely proactive approach to tackle the lack of birth registration. By increasing awareness through workshops and training, and by providing free legal services and advice, we work to prevent difficulties arising as well as identifying existing problems at an early stage of their development when they can be solved more easily.

Over the next three years, we aim to engage directly with 29,500 orphans and vulnerable children – ensuring they can access these vital documents, enrol in school, and enhance their ability to bring themselves out of poverty – and are in the final stages of negotiating a grant from a major institutional donor which would fully fund the costs of this work in Zimbabwe.",2014-05-04T06:09:02.551712,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'England', 'adminArea1': 'United Kingdom', 'adminArea4': 'Leeds', 'adminArea5': 'Leeds', 'streetAddress': '24 Roundhay Road', 'postalCode': 'LS7 1', 'formattedAddress': '24 Roundhay Road, Leeds, LS7 1'}, 'coords': [-1.532254, 53.808749]}",lKHI1rZITleF7L-c8F-i1g,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-10-16T23:54:00.000Z,49477-95,ushahidi,Zimbabwe Educational Trust: Educational Support for Zimbabwean Communities,"[{'name': 'Education', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Volunteerism', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Fundraising', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:31:47.191896,United Kingdom,England,Leeds,Leeds,"24 Roundhay Road, Leeds, LS7 1",LS7 1,24 Roundhay Road,"{'adminArea3': 'England', 'adminArea1': 'United Kingdom', 'adminArea4': 'Leeds', 'adminArea5': 'Leeds', 'streetAddress': '24 Roundhay Road', 'postalCode': 'LS7 1', 'formattedAddress': '24 Roundhay Road, Leeds, LS7 1'}","[-1.532254, 53.808749]",53.808749,-1.532254,Education,Volunteerism,Fundraising,en
2014-05-09 19:29:59.716865,"The Beyond Baroque Ocean Friendly Garden Demonstration Project is a collaboration between Surfrider Foundation-West LA/Malibu Chapter Ocean Friendly Gardens (OFG) Sub-committee and Beyond Baroque Literary / Arts Center, a community non-profit cultural organization that occupies the former Venice City Hall building owned by the City of Los Angeles.
  The 800 square foot OFG replaces a portion of the expansive but mostly dead turf in front of the highly visible and historic building. The two downspouts serve estimated roof tributary areas of 401 and 428 sf, which translates to 249 and 265 gallons. At 1"" of rain, this would capture 33 and 35 cu ft of water. The basins are 8' in diameter and 12"" deep which is about 50 cuft of storage capacity each. 
 The Project was awarded a $5,000 grant from the City of Los Angeles through the City's ""Keep Los Angeles Beautiful Grant."" The grant helped fund a portion of the costs.
  OFG Co-chairs Steve Williams and Tom Rau organized and conducted a series of three Hands-on Workshops (HOW) from April to June 2013. In the HOWs, community volunteers learned how to:

1. Grade a site for rainwater capture and sheet mulch;
2. Select and plant native plants, install drip irrigation; and
3. Perform maintenance using OFG conservation principles.

Each workshop provided a hands-on learning experience in OFG creation, which empowered participants to create their own home OFGs, how to communicate with a professional they might hire, and influence their community. The garden was designed by Tom Rau, who is a licensed Landscape Architect (www.tomrau-rla.com).

Rain water from two roof downspouts is piped underground to the garden, then emerge through “pop-up” devices into two mulched and planted retention basins (pictured above left and at right), with capacity to absorb and infiltrate the first 1” flush of rain water (the dirtiest part of a rain storm after a dry spell). The entire garden is surrounded by berms that also help prevent runoff from reaching the ocean.

Volunteers installed California native plants that will require little if any supplemental irrigation once established. A drip irrigation system was installed to aid establishment during the first few growing seasons, and a thick layer of bark mulch applied to feed the soil and conserve moisture.

Plants receive quarterly compost tea applications to boost the health of the soil and ensure the plants develop healthy roots and foliage without the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Community volunteers meet monthly for a few hours to weed and maintain the garden.

The total project cost was $14,000. Subtracting for the $5,000 grant, the remaining costs were covered by volunteer labor, and donated materials and services. Volunteers purchased materials with their own funds and submitted paid receipts for reimbursement from the grant which required completing paperwork and allowing time for City review and approvals. The project has been generally acknowledged a big success by the local community, primarily because Surfrider and Beyond Baroque worked well together in engaging and bringing together their respective community networks of volunteers and activists, getting them involved in building and maintaining the OFG.

The Center has an indoor performance space, which the Chapter will inquire about using to hold OFG classes. It would be great to have a class that is part indoors, then go outside to use the OFG as a learning tool.",2014-05-04T05:41:21.580419,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'CA', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Los Angeles Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Venice', 'streetAddress': '663 Venice Blvd', 'postalCode': '90291', 'formattedAddress': '663 Venice Blvd, Venice, CA 90291'}, 'coords': [-118.458859, 33.991346]}",RwQgKhfyQYaF6Q5svbiueg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-10-16T23:51:00.000Z,12605-142,ushahidi,Beyond Baroque Literary/Arts Center OFG,"[{'name': 'Retention - Downspout Re-direct', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Permeability - Healthy Living Soil', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Permeability - Permeable Hardscape', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Retention - Sponge Gardens', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Conservation - Irrigation', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Conservation - Mulch', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Conservation - Plants', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:29:59.716865,United States,CA,Los Angeles Co.,Venice,"663 Venice Blvd, Venice, CA 90291",90291,663 Venice Blvd,"{'adminArea3': 'CA', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Los Angeles Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Venice', 'streetAddress': '663 Venice Blvd', 'postalCode': '90291', 'formattedAddress': '663 Venice Blvd, Venice, CA 90291'}","[-118.458859, 33.991346]",33.991346,-118.458859,Retention - Downspout Re-direct,Permeability - Healthy Living Soil,Permeability - Permeable Hardscape,en

2014-05-09 19:29:23.627438,"THE ONTARIO SHOREWALK ASSOCIATION

About us:
We are a provincial organization whose main objective is to persuade the Ontario government to pass legislation that would guarantee the public a “Right of Passage”, walking rights, on our Great Lakes shoreline.  We have members throughout the province, alliances with like minded organizations on Lakes Ontario, Erie and Huron, and endorsements from municipalities and from international groups including the Chicago based Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative and Great Lakes United.

While public walking rights remain our primary objective we have also been active in local issues; beach front clean-up campaigns, youth involvement, improved signage, water quality, and improved use of existing public space.

From the start our long term objective has been and remains:  to develop an Ontario Great Lakes shoreline walking trail system.

Early History:  
It became increasingly clear in the mid 1900's that pressure to  make our Great Lakes more accessible to the public was mounting.  In the Niagara Peninsula Professor John Jackson, the Geography chair at Brock University, was commissioned to study public access to Lakes Erie and Ontario.  His report stated clearly that the need for more public access was urgent and needed to be addressed by government.  

Well, here we are some 50 years later with public lake access worse than in the 1960's.  This is our provincial  “tragedy of the commons”...many more people with much more pressure on our lakes as a public resource. 

Governments at all levels have failed to address the problem in a meaningful way and they seem to have abandoned all hope of alleviating this shameful situation.

In Tiny Township on Georgian Bay beaches that were once used by the public are now fenced off and visitors are ejected by the Ontario Provincial Police or uniformed private security guards.  

The Boundaries Act is being used to, in essence, to allow the apparently legal mass expropriation of public beachfront property by extending beachfront property lines to the water's edge.  This may be legal under the act but it's a gross social injustice to the Ontario public. 

While no precise figures exist it is clear that the public in Ontario is excluded from more than 90% of our Great Lakes shores!
 
How the Ontario Shorewalk Association began:
In July, 2005 the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the public had walking rights along all 5,000 km. of their state's shoreline on Lakes Erie, Huron, Superior and Michigan.  Within weeks we formed the Ontario Shorewalk Association with a goal of duplicating Michigan's success via the legislative route.  Despite repeated but failed attempts to pass a private member's bill through our our most ardent supporter and local Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Kim Craitor we continue to press for a legislative solution for our Right of Passage goal.

The Act-It is a “modest proposal” to at least allow the public to walk along Great Lakes shore lines between the water's edge and the high water mark.  It does not challenge any property rights but asserts the public's right of passage   (walking rights).

Limitations: 
Access to the lake shore can only be via public land such as road allowances and municipal, provincial or federal parks.  There will be obvious exceptions to right of passage such a harbour facilities, power stations and industrial sites.
 
The Petition:
We are petitioning Premier Wynne to introduce and pass legislation that would guarantee the same right of public access (walking rights) enjoyed by the public in Michigan. Click the 1st link.

Motorists who travel over the Mackinac Bridge in northern Michigan are treated to one of the most spectacular vistas in all the Great Lakes. The five-mile-long bridge crosses a vast expanse of cobalt water that extends far to the east and west, well beyond the reach of the naked eye. The view is sublime, breathtaking.

From the bridge, which peaks at 199 feet above the Straits of Mackinac, sightseers have a bird’s eye view of waters that mark the confluence of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. What they cannot see from the bridge, or anywhere else, is a looming threat that could devastate the upper Great Lakes.

Just west of the Mackinac Bridge, below the water’s surface, lie two pipelines, called Line 5, that carry a total of 22 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas fluids each day from Superior, Wisconsin to Sarnia, Ontario. The pipelines were placed in the Straits of Mackinac in 1953—the year President Dwight Eisenhower took office and before the Bridge was built.

If either of those pipelines leaked, the resulting oil slick would devastate some of the lakes’ most bountiful fisheries, wildlife refuges, municipal drinking water supplies and one of the region’s most popular tourist attractions: Mackinac Island. A significant rupture would cause an Exxon-Valdez scale oil spill spreading through Lakes Huron and Michigan, the heart of the largest freshwater seas in the world.

It’s not an empty risk: the pipelines are owned and operated by Canadian-based Enbridge Energy and Line 5 is part of the Lakehead system—one of the largest networks of pipelines in the world. Enbridge Energy is the same firm responsible for the largest and most costly inland tar sands oil spill in American history. These interstate pipeline networks are regulated federally by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which is a federal agency under the Department of Transportation that enforces pipeline safety rules and regulations.

An Enbridge pipeline that ruptured near Marshall, Michigan, in July 2010 dumped about one million gallons of tar sands oil into the Kalamazoo River system. Federal investigators were scathing in their critique, likening Enbridge to the “Keystone Kops” and determining that Enbridge could have prevented the disaster if the company had properly maintained the pipeline and fixed dozens of known defects.

The Enbridge pipelines that cross the Straits of Mackinac have never spilled oil into the conjoined waters of lake Michigan and Huron, according to government officials. But evidence is mounting that there is reason to be concerned.

The Line 5 pipeline that crosses the Straits has a history of problems, just like the company that owns it. Pipelines deteriorate as they age, according to engineering experts, and the Line 5 pipes at the Straits have been subjected to fierce underwater currents, intense external pressure and varying water temperatures for 60 years.

Compounding the threat is the fact that the pipelines cross the world’s largest source of surface freshwater, a sensitive ecosystem that cannot readily cope with large quantities of crude oil.

Additionally, Enbridge has set out to expand its Lakehead System—which includes Line 5—to carry more diluted bitumen and tar sands oil from western Canada. All of the lines within the Lakehead System transport Alberta tar sands-derived crude oil. Most concerning is the transportation of diluted raw tar sands oil or diluted bitumen (DilBit). Transportation of this product requires higher operating pressures, which in turn heats the line and could pose significantly higher risks of spills.

In this report, National Wildlife Federation examines the history of the Enbridge pipelines that cross the Straits of Mackinac, Enbridge’s environmental track record and what could happen if the pipes sprang a leak and pumped crude oil into the northernmost reaches of lakes Michigan and Huron.

This report is intended to point out the immediate need for proactive and consistent action to properly safeguard our Great Lakes from pipeline spills. History has proven that agencies and pipeline operators continue to favor a reactionary approach to pipeline oversight. Unless action is taken, an oil spill in the Straits of Mackinac isn’t a question of if—it’s a question of when.

Maude Barlow discuses her latest book, Blue Future, the final instalment in her water trilogy, which offers a powerful and timely look at the world's growing water crisis. Blue Future features inspiring stories of struggle and resistance from marginalized communities, as well as examples of government policies that work for people and the planet.

Featuring Mark Mattson of Lake Ontario Waterkeeper

See the video above of Maude speaking about:
- What is a Great Lakes Commons?
- Why we need a Commons approach?
- How can people get involved?

Her new book: ""Blue Future: protecting water for people and the planet forever"" details 4 new water principles:

Principle One: Water Is a Human Right chronicles the long fight to have the human right to water recognized and the powerful players still impeding this progress.

Principle Two: Water Is a Common Heritage and Public Trust argues that water must not become a commodity to be bought and sold on the open market.

Principle Three: Water Has Rights Too makes the case for the protection of source water and the need to make our human laws compatible with those of nature.

Principle Four: Water Will Teach Us How to Live Together urges us to come together around a common threat — the end of water — and find a way to live more lightly on this planet.

Currently the organisation is based in Calabar, Cross River state, Nigeria. Our mission is to work for the improvement of the plights of children, young people and women in Africa through information sharing, training, research and education and early intervention; bridging the gap between theory, policy and practice. 

Many children experience abuses every day from people they know/trust and sometime from people they don’t know and it threaten their survival, development and participation in society. It is in the recognition of these plights and threat to children that Edem Children Foundation has initiated ‘The Full Stop Campaign’ (TFSC).

TFSC is aimed at Improving the rights and survival of children in Cross River state, Nigeria through the building  of local capacity to deal with right issues at primary, secondary schools and community levels; raising awareness through public discus, media & publication, child help lines; building the capacity of teachers, parents, CSOs, government ministries and department/law enforcement/security agencies.
The campaign is to educate children on their rights, creating pioneering online counselling services which will help children to speak out for the first time about abuse(s) they have suffered as well as helping to protect thousands of children from future/possible abuses. 

The campaign will help support orphan and vulnerable children go back to school or learn life skills. Protecting children and young people from abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence is central to the ECF-TFS Campaign. Another component of the campaign will support the protection of children from preventable killer diseases like malaria, common worms, pneumonia, measles and diarrhoea. These diseases are the biggest killers of young children today causing more than 90% of deaths in children under five (UNICEF).

This campaign will be launch in December 2013, where The Full Stop Campaign Ambassadors will be named and honoured. ECF is soliciting for supporters for the Full Stop campaign (TFSC).
 
What you can do:
- We are requesting for corporate partnership with your organisation.
- Sponsor a child today to school or learn skill.
- Make a donation (no amount is too small).
- Sign on as corporate partnership
- Sign on as Full Stop Ambassador
- Volunteer for the campaign
- Sponsor a Child Help Line (A toll free telephone line for counselling of children). 
- Sponsor the development of interactive website for the TFS campaign.

Imagine a generation of children who have the knowledge to prevent abuse. Your support can make it happen. With your support we can give children the knowledge to help prevent abuse and protect a generation as well as give children survive from child killer diseases.

Ms. Gina Owens

 Manchester Center, VT 05255

Ms. Owens,

I am writing in regard to the electrical generating facility proposed for the Green Mountain National Forest in Searsburg and Readsboro, Vermont. I am an abutter (at 343 South Road, Route 8) to the Forest near where the generating facility is being proposed. My family owns the two closest houses to the existing generating station.

I am deeply concerned on the impact both on the wildlife, and on the general public’s (myself and my family included) ability to enjoy the uniquely beautiful area, that this industrial generating station will have.

My family has a history in Searsburg, dating to the early 19th century, when my great great grandfather moved to town. My parents first bought property in the early 1960′s. The attraction was obvious. It is a remote, still wild, location of a type that is rapidly disappearing. It is still the ‘old woods’.

A little less than ten years ago, a ‘small’ generating station of a ‘handful’ of windmills was proposed and rapidly sent through the approval process. This was to generate ‘clean’ energy that was reported to be no more intrusive than the sound of a ‘whisper’. I have endured the industrial droning for close to ten years, with the added arrhythmic clunk of the gears from the turning mechanisms. This is described as a ‘barely noticeable’ sound. I beg to differ. Due to this industrial noise pollution, I can no longer bring pets to the property, because the droning disorients them in the woods. The impact to the wildlife must be even more severe, despite the claims of the power company’s ‘consultants’. Regardless, my family’s enjoyment of the quiet of the woods is severely diminished.

Now there is proposed a bigger generating station, with larger windmills, complete with aircraft warning lights. I have yet to see a detail on exactly where these enormous structures are to be located. Where will they be in relation to my property? Will they overlook my house? Why hasn’t this been published? I suspect that is because they will be a huge eyesore. How can anyone expect a public response when these details have never been released? The propaganda pictures that the electric company published were taken five miles from the Searsburg town line. I do not consider this honest.

The ‘public’ comment phase of this project has been initiated without a clear plan as to what is being proposed. One can only assume that the power company considers residents of Searsburg, Readsboro, and all of Vermont to be simple ‘hicks’, who wouldn’t understand the ‘complicated’ details. 

Will there be 400 foot tall electrical generators overlooking my house? Will the pristine landscape be turned into an industrial park? Will this wild expanse of nature resemble a metropolitan airport with its landing lights? I request that more details on this project to be made public before the public input period is completed. 

When the existing windmills were proposed, there was supposedly no opposition to them. The power company published(!) pictures of the view from our property that were taken while they were trespassing. They said that they had heard no opposition to the proposal. It should not have been hard to find a family in a town of less than 100, who had been there since the early sixty’s. Yet the power company claimed that they had contacted all of the abutters. They had not contacted us, nor ANY of the other families that had their view of the mountains spoiled by these huge industrial machines. (They apparently only contacted tourists who never venture far from the road on the way to their ski vacations.) They subsequently published a glowing report that everyone they contacted liked the idea of the generators. This is a conclusion they decided on prior to contacting anyone. It is not intellectually valid. 

Consider this letter documentation that I am opposed to any further industrialization of the forest.

I request that the proposed project be put on hold until ALL information regarding it is provided to the public, including exact locations of where each of these enormous electrical generators and high intensity strobe lights will be located.

Based on the last time this type of action happened, I cannot expect anything good to come of it. Hopefully the fact that it is on public land will have some bearing. I would like to think that I am one of the citizen landowners, and as such, would have some say as to whether this is a good idea. It is not, given the detail that has been provided.

Please contact me if more details on this project become available or if there is a further opportunity to comment.

It is understood that the stem of a wind turbine collapsed on to a digger as it was being moved yesterday. The accident took place at a site used by Siemens at Belfast harbour where wind farms are being manufactured.

The Belfast Telegraph understands one of the wind turbine stems fell on top of a Manitou digger as it was being moved.

One worker told the Belfast Telegraph that after the accident happened they were ""herded into the canteen"".

""One of the wind turbines was knocked down, these are 140ft in height, it came down on what is known as a Manitou,"" he said.

There is an AVHRR sensor on the NOAA series satellites. It does a daily coverage of the global oceans, since 1981.
There is a MODIS sensor on the Terra and Aqua satellite, as well as a TOMS sensor on the Nimbus, ADEOSI and EP satellite, which does daily coverage of global land and oceans, starting as early as 1997. They have been monitoring the loading and sizing and shaping of chemtrail spraying as well.
There is a MISR sensor on the Terra and an OMI sensor on the Aura satellite, operating since 2000 and 2005 respectfully.
The POLDER-1, -2, and PARASOL satellites have been monitoring chemtrail spraying dispursion on land and ocean since 1997.
The TOMS sensor on the NIMBUS, ADEOSI and EP satellites have been monitoring the “absorbing aerosol index, the single-scattering albedo, and the absorbing optical depth on land and ocean"". Also doing this at other times is the OMI sensor on Aura satellite, and the MISR sensor on the Terra satellite. They have been measuring the chemtrail absorption.
The satellites that measure the loading, sizing, and shape of chemtrails are the GLAS sensor on the ICESat satellite (2003 to present for 3 months a year), and the CALIOP sensor on the CALIPSO satellite – from 2006 to present. CALIPSO and Aqua take coincident observations of the change in radiation (energy and heat) in a layer of the atmosphere. CALIPSO and CloudSat are highly complementary and together provide new, never-before-seen 3-D perspectives of how clouds and aerosols (CHEMTRAILS) form, evolve, and affect weather and climate.

This innovative, simple technology provides a safe and effective method for controlling blood loss and preventing PPH. Because the device is inexpensive, accessible, and easy to use, it allows birth attendants with varied levels of medical education and training backgrounds to facilitate service delivery in hard-to-reach, low resource settings of developing countries where women are vulnerable to PPH.

2014-05-09 19:28:29.761224,"On October 1, international news agency Inter-Press Service published a story in which a reporter recounts witnessing an interrogation of a shabiha (plainclothes militia) member in Ma’arret An-Nu’man, in Idlib province. The shabiha member said he raped at least three women and that he “was forced to take part in rapes and killings.”

A local Free Syrian Army officer and the commander of a local division of the Suqour Al-Sham Brigade interrogated the man, who said his name was Mustafa.

From a Palestinian refugee community near Hama, Mustafa told the FSA members that he and other shabiha members raped the wife of a man who refused to give them free fuel, according to the report. They did it as an “intimidation tactic,” he said. The story states that the correspondent “could not ascertain whether this was a confession made only under pressure after capture.”

Mustafa also said he’d raped a pharmacist in Hama who “refused to sell sedatives used by the militia after she found out it was a false prescription.”

He went on to tell the FSA members that he had been forced to rape his brother's wife to “get her to persuade her husband to join the irregular militia “and that he threatened to tell her husband about the rape if he didn’t join. He did join, Mustafa said. The Inter-Press reporter asked Mustafa what would have happened if his brother discovered his wife had been raped. He “brushed off the question, seemingly annoyed by it,” according to the story. “The ‘intelligence officer’ said her husband would have killed her, it would have been a question of family honor.”

The detainee told the FSA that he was “not responsible for his actions because he had been under the influence of drugs given to the fighters of the irregular militia without their knowledge.”

The dates and exact locations of the reported assaults are unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:24:05.408861,,"{'addressComponents': {'streetAddress': '56', 'adminArea1': 'Syria', 'formattedAddress': '56, Syria'}, 'coords': [36.752449, 35.13781]}",3WsbymymRWiHo0a5sSDFjg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-10-01T19:02:00.000Z,34369-243,ushahidi,Shabiha member tells FSA officers he raped at least three women,"[{'name': '3SF.

2014-05-09 19:28:29.669693,"In October 2013, a woman named Um Yasin, 35, was detained at the Political Security Branch in Damascus, according to an activist named Rana Alnabky.

“I was arrested based on a report sent to security forces about me,” Um Yasin said. “Syrian forces picked me up in a shelter in Damascus. I was taken to a security branch, blindfolded, and when I entered the branch I was led along with many women to be 'inspected.' I was shocked when I found out that ‘inspection’ consisted of stripping us completely then making us squat in full view of five soldiers. When my turn came, I was pushed and slapped by a soldier when he kept trying to strip me even after I had taken off my outer coat. He insisted I even take of my undershirt and bra. He complained to his superior about me, and threatened that if I did not strip I would face some kind of other treatment. I gave in and took off all my clothes. They even pulled my hair loose and threw it around, thinking I may have hid something in my hair. They asked us all to squat and then walk in front of them.”

Um Yasin was released 10 days after her arrest, and has not told her husband or anyone else besides Alnabky what happened to her. Whenever she is asked about the treatment she received in prison, she says, “Thank God, I was not subjected to anything that has to do with my honor.”

Alnabky told WMC’s Women Under Siege that Um Yasin suffers from psychological effects including severe anxiety symptoms, and has been reviewed by a mental health specialist because she says she feels fatigued and under great emotional pressure.

Aside, Um Yasin told Alnabky the story of a 13-year-old girl who was held in her same cell. One time, Um Yasin said, the girl returned from an interrogation session by falling into the cell unconscious. When she came to, the girl told Um Yasin and her cellmates the following story:

“Three officers sat in front of me after they had forced me to strip completely naked. They told me to walk, turn around, and squat. They would ask me, ‘Are you not ashamed of yourself? Are you not ashamed that you are the niece of [they would say the name of her uncle, who works with Syrian security forces]?’” 

The girl said she replied each time that she was not ashamed. 

One of the officers told another, “Check if she looks like a virgin,” according to the activist.

‘How can I tell, sir?” the man asked. “With my finger?’

“No, with a stick,” he allegedly said.

The girl stressed that the soldiers did not do anything to her along these lines, and Um Yasin told the activist that she is unsure whether the girl was subjected to sexualized violence beyond threats.

The exact dates of the reported attacks are unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC's Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:24:11.201787,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea1': 'Syria', 'formattedAddress': 'Damascus, Syria', 'adminArea5': 'Damascus'}, 'coords': [36.309581, 33.51307]}",ZBaKFFnZSO-H9ax-69Qx0A,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-10-01T02:36:00.000Z,34369-261,ushahidi,Woman reports being forced to undress for Damascus detention officers,"[{'name': '2GF.

The tour will provide an opportunity to highlight pressing issues in each of these communities:

    Duluth, Minnesota - April 4
    Milwaukee, Wisconsin - April 15
    Grand Rapids, Michigan - April 16
    Rochester, New York - April 25
    Toronto, Ontario - April 27
    Saugeen Shores, Ontario - August 1
    Bayfield, Ontario - September 28

The Council of Canadians is organizing this second part of the Great Lakes tour with FLOW, On the Commons and other allies. In May 2012, during the first part of this Great Lakes tour, Barlow spoke in Toronto, Hamilton, Thunder Bay, Kingston, Sarnia, Tiny Township, Owen Sound and London.

The tour will help:

* Foster connections along the Great Lakes by making the links between current fights against threats such as pollution, fracking, bottled water withdrawals, invasive species, and nuclear waste storage and shipments.
* Cultivate a Great Lakes stewardship by encouraging people to recognize they not only have a right, but a responsibility to protect the Great Lakes’ waters.
* Invite community involvement and encourage inspiring actions that will help shift the current market economy priorities that govern the Great Lakes to priorities based on commons and public trust principles.",2014-05-04T05:33:57.971186,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Huron', 'adminArea5': 'Bluewater', 'streetAddress': 'Jane St', 'postalCode': 'N0M', 'formattedAddress': 'Jane St, Bluewater, ON N0M, Canada'}, 'coords': [-81.696007, 43.560907]}",BfSIcC2_RtmrlT8gXrF8jA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-09-28T19:00:00.000Z,36776-128,ushahidi,"Bayfield, ON: 2013 Talking Tour for Our Great Lakes Commons","[{'name': 'Healing', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:29:24.083734,Canada,ON,Huron,Bluewater,"Jane St, Bluewater, ON N0M, Canada",N0M,Jane St,"{'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Huron', 'adminArea5': 'Bluewater', 'streetAddress': 'Jane St', 'postalCode': 'N0M', 'formattedAddress': 'Jane St, Bluewater, ON N0M, Canada'}","[-81.696007, 43.560907]",43.560907,-81.696007,Healing,,,en

2014-05-09 19:29:23.545623,"The Ontario Energy Board is about to make a major decision about piping fracked gas to Toronto for distribution in southwestern Ontario and Quebec. Enbridge Gas Distribution and Union Gas are petitioning the Ontario Energy Board for new and expanded natural gas infrastructure in the Greater Toronto Area. If the application is approved, millions of people will be relying on imported fracked gas from the U.S. Marcellus shale by 2015.

The approval could open the door to more fracking of the Marcellus shale posing serious risks to the Great Lakes Basin with massive water withdrawals, potential water contamination and pipeline leaks and hazardous waste risks. In addition to being a major threat to Great Lakes communities’ water and air and contributing significantly to climate change pollution, this approval would lead to higher heating costs for Ontario and Quebec residents.

We are passionate about ensuring that children and young people achieve their potential and  we believe that education is one of the most effective ways of empowering  individuals to improve their own lives and their local communities. 
Charityhope Trust began operations in 2010 by sending used and new books to rural areas of Zimbabwe. We have been distributing reading books, stationery and t-shirts for under privileged rural children in Zimbabwe.

We always hear about food famine and poverty in Africa, but the book famine in still a BIG reality. The awareness and culture of book reading is not yet embedded especially remote rural schools partly due to lack of access to educational resources. Lack of libraries, lack of reading books and stationery at home and in schools, children dropping out of schools due to lack of funds and uniforms are common features in rural Zimbabwe. As a result, underprivileged children and young people are caught by the web of poverty at a tender age and will find it hard to escape from the shackles of illiteracy and poverty thereby limiting their potential as well as their personal growth and development.

Access to education is one of the opportunities children and young people have to break the cycle of poverty and attain a better quality of life and enhance life chances.",2014-05-04T06:09:09.445837,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'Midlands', 'adminArea1': 'Zimbabwe', 'formattedAddress': 'Kwekwe, Zimbabwe', 'adminArea5': 'Kwekwe'}, 'coords': [29.154857, -19.015438]}",TkRC1HGXSxOy0Z8Qlyg--w,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-08-30T01:05:00.000Z,49477-83,ushahidi,Charityhope Trust: Building libraries in remote rural areas of Zimbabwe,"[{'name': 'Education', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:33:02.698173,Zimbabwe,Midlands,,Kwekwe,"Kwekwe, Zimbabwe",,,"{'adminArea3': 'Midlands', 'adminArea1': 'Zimbabwe', 'formattedAddress': 'Kwekwe, Zimbabwe', 'adminArea5': 'Kwekwe'}","[29.154857, -19.015438]",-19.015438,29.154857,Education,,,en

2014-05-09 19:33:02.611672,"Practical science education in Uganda (and many other African countries) is almost universally inadequate. For a number of students, their first hands-on experience of science is during the O-Level practical exams. As a result, they lose interest and score poorly on exams — chemistry, physics and biology have the lowest pass rates out of all major subjects in O-level examinations. This means Africa loses many potential doctors, engineers and researchers.

TASTE’s chief activity is the operation of a mobile science laboratory which visits schools providing practical science experience to students. The first mobile laboratory is now operating in Lwengo District, Uganda. It does a circuit of a large number of schools, reaching each one every three weeks and delivering a set of action-packed practical lessons.

The mobile laboratory consists of a van carrying everything needed to rapidly set up a teaching lab at any school. It contains standard laboratory equipment for a range of experiments, and demonstrations which can be shown to the class at the start and end of session. Each day we bring different experiments to different schools, and over the course of a year each student gets the chance to carry out experiments encompassing the breadth of modern science.

One key advantage of a mobile science laboratory is that one set of equipment can be used to serve multiple schools. Many schools do not have the funds to buy a full set of laboratory equipment and chemicals, so this shared approach helps a limited set of resources go a long way.

Many of these children live with their siblings, but with no adult support, in very small and ramshackle child-headed houses and work on the streets to support themselves. This is a dangerous existence! Child prostitution is common, as are accidents and illness; life expectancy is short. Most cannot afford uniforms or even pens and pencils to enable them to attend a government school.

By providing not only education, but also food, uniforms and sensitive support, the project enables the children to attend school, and provides an opportunity for the children to break the cycle of poverty, for themselves and their families.

""Kalkaska has become the centre of fracking in Michigan with more fracking permits and active applications than any other county in the state. What’s more, not only is Canadian company Encana planning to frack 500 new deep shale wells in the area but they are breaking records with the amount of water they are using to frack Kalkaska’s wells. 

According to the National Wildlife Federation’s report Hydraulic Fracturing in the Great Lakes Basin: The State of Play in Michigan in Ohio, most fracked wells in the Utica shale use between 7.5 and 22.7 million litres of water but Encana has reported that it used 45 million litres of groundwater per well to frack the Excelsior 2-25 and Garfield 1-25 wells and 80 million litres of groundwater to frack its Excelsior 3-25 well. Recent news reports revealed that Ecana wants to withdraw 15 billion litres of water for the 500 new wells they plan to frack.

Michigan may soon be the state with the most fracking within the Great Lakes Basin, making Kalkaska County the centre of fracking in the Great Lakes Basin. Ohio and Pennsylvania are Great Lakes states with a significant amount of fracking but most of the fracking within these states occurs outside of the Basin.""

The Blue Flag program uses a commons approach to beach management and environmental stewardship. Blue Flag beaches have to be free to the public and wheelchair accessible, and the program encourages community involvement in the stewardship of our beaches. This is achieved through the Blue Flag criteria, which is divided into four categories: environmental education, water quality, environmental management and safety and services. In order to be awarded a Blue Flag, a beach must meet all 32 criteria.
 
Because the Blue Flag program is multi-faceted, it promotes partnerships between various levels of government, staff, community members and non-profits. In each Blue Flag community, the program is overseen by a volunteer beach management committee that monitors the beach and makes sure the criteria are being met. On the international level, the criteria are constantly reviewed and strengthened by experts from around the world. This voluntary, collaborative approach makes Blue Flag a unique and effective program for protecting our coastlines.

The Blue Flag program uses a commons approach to beach management and environmental stewardship. Blue Flag beaches have to be free to the public and wheelchair accessible, and the program encourages community involvement in the stewardship of our beaches. This is achieved through the Blue Flag criteria, which is divided into four categories: environmental education, water quality, environmental management and safety and services. In order to be awarded a Blue Flag, a beach must meet all 32 criteria.
 
Because the Blue Flag program is multi-faceted, it promotes partnerships between various levels of government, staff, community members and non-profits. In each Blue Flag community, the program is overseen by a volunteer beach management committee that monitors the beach and makes sure the criteria are being met. On the international level, the criteria are constantly reviewed and strengthened by experts from around the world. This voluntary, collaborative approach makes Blue Flag a unique and effective program for protecting our coastlines.

2014-05-09 19:09:18.399344,"Hi guys... going to keep this as brief as possible.

It is only in the last couple of months I have been aware of lawful rebellion and the severity of the corrupt governments that control us and I intend to educate myself as much as possible though obviously as I'm sure your all aware there is an awful lot to learn!

My question today is..

Back in April I received a PCN from Manchester council because I returned to my car 4 minutes after the paid for ticket expired. For a good few minutes before the ticket expired I was attempting to extend the ticket I had purchased by phone and using an iphone app put in place by Manchester city council however their systems failed me and I received the ticket. At this point I was not aware of lawful rebellion and the true nature of parking tickets etc.

For this reason I appealed the notice, in writing, obviously unknowingly admitting to being the legal personality of myself. The appeal was refused and they say I am still liable.

Because I have already written into the council, acknowledging the PCN and admitting responsibility for it, is it too late to refuse to pay the ticket using the lawful rebellion process detailed on this website? Additionally, my car is registered to my sister's private Company as the registered keeper for insurance purposes - does this complicate the matter in anyway?

I did actually decide to pay the fine on this occasion purely to reduce the hassle involved, however when I have finally managed to get on the council's website at a time when it was working properly, the PCN has now risen from £25 to £75 which makes me more inclined to do whatever I can to refuse it.

I am wondering - whether or not I should continue to appeal the fine in the usual way, pleading my case as I did in the original appeal back in May, or whether I should take the approach of the lawful rebellion to dispute the charge.

Many thanks in advance,

Jay

This is a pipelines plan to pump tar sands oil product through the Great Lakes bioregion.

You can read the full submission in the Waterkeeper link provided. (general information about Line 9 in the Environmental Defence link).

The four groups submit the following:

1. Leaks or spills from Line 9 have the potential to cause serious and irreversible harm to the environment.

2. Pipeline breaches can occur for a variety of reasons, allowing material to enter the environment.

3. Enbridge has a record of failing to prevent major leaks and spills and failing to respond to spills in a timely manner.

4. Leaks or spills from this pipeline can and should be prevented.

5. Enbridge must be held accountable for any leaks or spills from this pipeline.

Detailed information regarding each point can be found in the full report.

Recommendations:

1. Replace the existing pipeline with thicker pipe or reducing the diameter of the pipeline in order to improve the D/t ratio.

2. Use double insulated pipeline, either along the entire length of Line 9, or at a minimum, wherever the pipeline meets a waterbody, wetland, or sensitive area of any size.

3. Install best available technology to detect leaks sooner and at smaller volumes than the current system allows.

4. Locate automatic and remote control shutoff valves in close proximity to one another to minimize the volume of spills, should they occur.

5. Locate shutoff valves on either side (upstream and downstream) of every waterbody or wetland crossed by the pipeline.

6. Ensure that activities intended to improve or modify the pipeline do not have negative environmental impacts.

7. Guarantee that Enbridge assumes full financial and legal liability for all clean-up, remediation, and monitoring required in the event of a leak or spill of any size to the environment.

2014-05-09 19:33:02.523942,"Normally when a complex is being planned to construct a multistory housing apartment in a compact city like Dhaka of Bangladesh, the rich ecology there are left unattended and unwatered for the long period of 12 to 18 months between the agreement signing and obtaining authority approval. Most of the plants die in the mean time. Slum dwellers collect some for fuel wood. The left overs are bulldozed and thrown away by the company while construction starts.

But in this unique initiative of a tiny Farmers’ Research Institute Krisoker Sor (Farmers’ Voice), we were courageous enough to take the initiative of saving the +95 species of plants, trees and herbs. More that 5000 plants were saved finally and have been relocated. 

Four groups of stakeholders were mainly related to the initiative. Namely, the fund provider, ecology owner, construction company and the community around.
Fund provider was ready to fund on installment. So there was always risk of loosing fund if failure prevailed in any stage. 

We had to demonstrate affection and technical know-how to the ecology for long four years to convince the owner. But at later stage, we had to buy the whole ecology with the estimation of fuel wood. Construction company is always hurry to clear the existing ecology and thus make the land barren. Thus to ease the planning procedure. For that reason, there were great pressure to the owner for handing over the complex. The owner played his role in a very efficient way. So we have enough time to prepare the plants to shift.

The community around was the most difficult stakeholder to be convinced. But a series of meetings and regular demonstration made them ease to support the initiative. Children in the community played a critical role here.
The process and mechanisms of changing the stakeholders’ attitude and behaviour towards the initiative was complex. It also interesting that how the institute is being invited now a days to save and relocate plants.",2014-05-04T06:09:15.261798,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'Dhaka', 'adminArea1': 'Bangladesh', 'adminArea4': 'Dhaka', 'adminArea5': 'Dhaka', 'streetAddress': 'Street', 'formattedAddress': 'Street, Dhaka, Bangladesh'}, 'coords': [90.447443, 23.838228]}",o6qARyoaR7eeb5Y4Rz9MeA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-08-10T22:25:00.000Z,49477-68,ushahidi,Farmers' Voice: Ecology Relocation for Urban Greenspace Management,"[{'name': 'Education', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Agriculture', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Environment', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:33:02.523942,Bangladesh,Dhaka,Dhaka,Dhaka,"Street, Dhaka, Bangladesh",,Street,"{'adminArea3': 'Dhaka', 'adminArea1': 'Bangladesh', 'adminArea4': 'Dhaka', 'adminArea5': 'Dhaka', 'streetAddress': 'Street', 'formattedAddress': 'Street, Dhaka, Bangladesh'}","[90.447443, 23.838228]",23.838228,90.447443,Education,Agriculture,Environment,en

2014-05-09 19:32:54.121789,"Patrick's fourth talk on the aerosol spraying of the sky by aircraft that the skies are being covered with every day will be much different from the previous talks. 

The weather modification experiments have been going on since around 1998 across the world without the public's consent. Governments won't admit it. Press cannot discuss it and environmental groups will not address it. So it's up to us to tell you what is happening. 

Respiratory problems are through the roof. Doctors are not permitted to look for heavy metals in patient's blood and the majority of the public are unaware of the danger. 

The huge streaks one sees across the sky are not condensation trails of water vapour. They are sprayed by unmarked military and private aircraft from specially converted wings which have nozzles fitted. 

They then spread out to form banks of cloud filled with aluminium oxide, barium salts, strontium, molds, fungus, bacteria, polymer fibres and many other elements by the ton. This operation is above the government and is most likely a military/private partnership. Hundreds of patents have been filed for exactly that and the House of Commons Report on Geoengineering admits it's possible to so-called 'reflect the sun's rays back into space to ...combat global warming'.

In the talk patrick will present possible reasons for why it is being done based on the reports from Geoengineers themselves and the people who fund them. 

This generation is still fit enough to warn people of this vast crime against humanity. The next generation will not be as fit if the spraying continues. 

The richest people on the planet are altering the very climate of the planet so the race is on to reach enough momentum in the public's awareness before it's too late.

Clearly it is too late for the bees and the butterflies though we may still be able to save the trees from the die-back happening around the world. 

The future of the human race, in it's present form, is at stake. It really is that serious. The government won't tell you so we will.

Four years of research on Chemtrails is to be unleashed and it's time to rattle the bars of the cage.

2014-05-09 19:33:03.447997,"This initiative developed a Right to Information (RTI) Toolkit for Nepali journalists to allow them to better use Nepal's 2007 Right to Information Act and the provisions within it for investigative journalism. The toolkit is being used to increase awareness of citizen rights and entitlements; draw attention to institutional and governance failings; foster the exchange of ideas and knowledge, and generate debate; and create pressure for better, more accountable government.

Background:

Freedom to access information about the functioning of government and other crucial organs is vital for any robust democracy. One of the most effective ways to combat poor governance is using this information to hold the government accountable and move beyond the secrecy that is sometimes built into government systems. The public has a right to know, for example, how the government is spending taxes and where policies and programs are being implemented well or poorly. As such, freedom of information is a central component of a transparent, effective and equitable state, and an open, responsible society.

The media- and journalists themselves- are a crucial part of this process, because when they make proper use of their Right to Information (RTI) to collect facts, they can disseminate this information to a wide audience, thereby providing a check on the traditional levers of power. With the power of outreach and the ability to influence policymakers, thought-leaders and the general public, journalists can highlight issues of national importance and public interest while holding the state accountable. It is critical, therefore, that journalists understand how to use RTI laws. Unfortunately, journalists in many countries, including Nepal under-utilize RTI laws. 

This Toolkit provides step by step instructions to submit requests for information under the RTI law in Nepal. Additionally, it tries to identify potential problem areas journalists may encounter while seeking information under the Act and provides tips to tackle these problems. 

The Toolkit is divided into 4 sections.  The first section outlines the RTI law in Nepal; the domain and exemptions of the  Act; and the procedures for filing an RTI request and appeal. The second section discusses the usefulness of RTI as a journalistic tool, citing international examples to elaborate how the legislation can be used to uncover crucial issues. The third section lists potential problems that may arise while seeking information under the RTI Act and provides tips to deal with each potential issue. It also explains how newspapers and media houses can reorient themselves to encourage investigative journalism. The fourth section provides a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) and answers on the use of the RTI Act for investigative journalism.",2014-05-04T06:09:23.254187,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'Gandakī', 'adminArea1': 'Nepal', 'adminArea4': 'Kaski', 'formattedAddress': 'Namarjung, Nepal', 'adminArea5': 'Namarjung'}, 'coords': [84.124008, 28.394857]}",3NVBSnB4Ttu006Y6DXhOfA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-08-08T03:32:00.000Z,49477-67,ushahidi,Accountability Lab: RTI Toolkit for Investigative Journalism Nepal,"[{'name': 'Education', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Other', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:33:03.447997,Nepal,Gandakī,Kaski,Namarjung,"Namarjung, Nepal",,,"{'adminArea3': 'Gandakī', 'adminArea1': 'Nepal', 'adminArea4': 'Kaski', 'formattedAddress': 'Namarjung, Nepal', 'adminArea5': 'Namarjung'}","[84.124008, 28.394857]",28.394857,84.124008,Education,Other,,en

All stakeholders on campuses (students, professors and administrators) can text the free short-code (8355 or “TELL”) and are called back by an operator who gathers details of the problems faced and any ideas on solutions. This information is discussed on a periodic basis with the university administration and student government, who agree on both sides on relevant steps to be taken.

For Immediate Release
July 29, 2013

Maude Barlow to speak in defence of the Great Lakes in Port Elgin on Thursday, August 1st. 

Maude Barlow, National Chairperson of the Council of Canadians, is on a seven-city speaking tour in Canada and the United States to talk about Great Lakes threats such as low lake levels, pollution, nuclear waste, over-extraction, climate change and invasive species and to call for a bold shift in Great Lakes governance. 

The event will take place in the wake of a significant victory – Bruce Power has cancelled its intended radioactive shipments on the Great Lakes, a risky plan the Council of Canadians had actively campaigned to prevent.

The “Great Lakes Need Great Friends” tour arrives in Port Elgin Thursday, August 1, starting at 7 p.m. at The Plex (Rotary Hall in the Saugeen Shores Town Complex, 600 Tomlinson Drive, Port Elgin). Further details about the tour are available here. The public forum will be a free event, but donations are appreciated.

Community members and water experts joining Barlow for a panel discussion include:

•	Mayor Mike Bradley of Sarnia, ON and a member of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative
•	Chief Randall Kahgee, Saugeen First Nation
•	Mary Muter, water levels expert, Sierra Club of Canada
•	Chris Peabody, City Councillor of Brockton, ON

“We’ve seen amazing work by many environmental organizations and some governments, and we’ve made some big gains, but we’re still seeing serious threats to North America’s largest water supply,” says Barlow. “Our governments have to start listening to communities who are saying ‘no’ to tar sands, fracking, bottled water and other projects that can deplete or pollute our water supplies. The future of the Great Lakes depends on it.”

Barlow is calling for the Great Lakes to be recognized as a commons and a public trust to be shared, protected and managed by those living around them. The vision is based on the human right to water, incorporates public input and prioritizes public and Indigenous rights over private interests.

2014-05-09 19:28:28.747716,"A July 29 Vanity Fair story reported what happened to a 25-year-old woman called “Nada” (not her real name), a member of a Syrian youth organization from Aleppo, who said she was held for eight months by the government for putting up revolutionary posters. She shared her story from a safe house in Turkey near the Syrian border. Originally arrested in Aleppo, Nada said she was held at various prisons and detention centers, including “one of the most renowned torture centers in Damascus.”

Nada’s incarceration involved significant abuse, including beatings, threats, and psychological torture, in addition to sexual assault, she said. While in custody, she said, she was partially stripped, blindfolded, and tied to a chair where she was passed  “from man to man” and threatened with sexualized violence. She endured severe beatings including a blow to the face so forceful that “her orthodontia broke through her skin.” 

“Talk or we will strip you,” she said her interrogators threatened. 

Nada did not use the word “rape,” the article says, but an NGO worker told the author that “she had been subject to sexual abuse and had ‘probably been raped’ while there. ‘But she needs to rebuild her life, and you know what rape means in Syrian society.’

“It means no one will marry her,” the NGO worker said. “So she cannot say it.”

During one episode, Nada said, she was taken to a cell full of male prisoners dressed in their underwear where she was told that she would be left alone so that the male prisoners might  “take care of me.”

“I thought I was being given to these men for them to rape me.” She then shared, “I think I screamed for three hours. They wanted to break me. Finally, I said, ‘OK, I will tell you the truth.’”

Nada described being forced to watch a male prisoner being sodomized; recalling this memory led her to shake and vomit, according to the story.

The dates and exact locations of the reported sexualized violence are unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:23:57.398561,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea1': 'Syria', 'formattedAddress': 'Halab (Aleppo), Syria', 'adminArea5': 'Halab (Aleppo)'}, 'coords': [37.159279, 36.215549]}",0arpFyVrQl-F4W7iUY4LkA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-07-29T20:51:00.000Z,34369-237,ushahidi,"Woman, 25, tells Vanity Fair of sexual abuse in multiple detention centers","[{'name': '2GF.

(The First Day)
 
On a hill near the southern shore of Lake Erie two young parents chose to adopt a little girl they did not know after coming to watch her on the swings as she watched the lake. They did not think much of the fact that the Lake Erie basin generated and bore me nor consider the implications of my drinking the lake daily for the better part of this life. They never spoke to me of the profundity of Erie’s water dribbling down my chin after biting fruit that she has engorged through backyard waterings. Her water in my body has been an emerging sacrament that none of us recognized.

On the day of my awakening to Lake Erie, she is grey and green and dark and reflective. Restless. Engulfing. Gulls notice her every gesture. I attend to the water and notice what I notice.

Awareness of her magnificent, enormous, trembling Being fills me with a tacit understanding of all the years of my deep water dreaming, of water imagery in my art forms, of the deeply felt necessity to dwell in water-lands. It fills me with a lively sense of the water, taking me beyond mere experiences into a boundary-less feeling-space.

This understanding is not of the mind but in the body and at the heart center. I feel to the water, leaning from the heart with great intensity, and say to her, “I give myself to you. I do not know what this means but my work is a service arising from you and I feel you giving it as a gift. I dedicate myself to you in completion of the gift.” And in that instant, I “awake” to the elegant, undivided Knowledge of water as a Living Being.

(The Second Day) 

On this day I am disturbed in my body. Ordinary requirements make no sense and my practice is not aligned with the gifts of the previous day. I feel rankled and sour, wanting only to rest in contemplation, to have just one moment to honor the gift, forgetting that every moment is given to either honor the gift or to make sacrilege of it. My husband suggests I go back to the lake.

As I enter the lakefront park at downtown Cleveland, Ohio (a different part of the shore than yesterday), a large lake gull is perched on a pier. It is a magnificent bird – white with gray on parts of its white wings. The tips of the wings are a long splash of black with a row of white spots.

We consider each other for a very long time. I feel to it, again leaning from the heart with great intensity, “You are beautiful! I want you to feel my appreciation! You are just beautiful! Your feathers are stunning! I would be so grateful to find just one feather like that to become part of my lake totem; a feather to carry my intention for this work.” When I walk on, this thought is held very lightly and then forgotten.

This day the sky and water are nearly the same color and resonance. They are soft, misty grey and clouds slightly emerge from time to time. Their shapes are a swept form, tinted by late-in-the-day light. I sit on a wall, watching. One-by-one, forty-three geese melt across the glassy surface to a far break-wall; their pace is measured and untroubled. 

My breathing becomes measured and untroubled, too, and I finally feel ready to transition with the water’s gifts into the context of my ordinary living. Leaving the park, I am alone in the cultivated space of lawn, trees, piers, and city skyline. 

As I walk past an upward sloping area of grass I notice a white fluff on the green ahead. Here are not merely feathers but two perfectly excised white wings from a gull identical to the one to which I was sending love just an hour before. Of this second gully, there is absolutely nothing left but the wings. This surgical amputation could only have been done by a hawk, one that perhaps makes its home on the nearby skyscrapers.

Having hoped for a single feather, I am thunderstruck by the gift of two whole and exquisite wings, a pair made for flight. And I am deeply moved by the ceremony of life and death enacted by both prey and predator that seems an intentional communication by this place where land and water meet. By this sign, the water obligates me to its service, and I accept.

2014-05-09 19:30:00.663255,"For my project we had 3100 sq. ft. of turf we removed, for which we received a rebate check from the county for $3100.00 after we finished.  That paid for most, if not all of the plants and materials we used.  I started off by renting a sod cutter and cutting the top layer of grass, then rolling up and removing it.  Next I raked out as many remaining roots as possible. Some people choose to spray their yard with herbicides to kill their grass rather than dig it up and compost it like I did.  While this may be a quicker result, I don’t like the idea of spraying these highly toxic substances on my yard that could affect my family, neighbor’s pets, wildlife, water quality, etc.  I then contoured the yard and formed the dry creek bed and bio-swales where I wanted to capture as much rain water runoff from the property as possible.  I incorporated my landscape design around the downspouts from my roof and how I would use this runoff in my landscape.  After contouring the soil I covered the entire site with compost, watered heavily, and then put down a layer of cardboard as a bio-degradable weed barrier.   After all the cardboard was in place we got some Surfrider volunteers to help put in the plants and then covered it all with 4-6 inches of mulch.  Our landscape also has a large portion of veggie boxes and edibles, and the 6 fruit trees are all irrigated with grey water from our washing machine which further reduces our water usage.  We have approximately 1600 sq. ft. of roof plus another 5000 sq. ft. of yard and driveway which captures a lot of rainwater.  All of this rainwater is diverted into the yard and using bio-swales, staying on the property, preventing runoff and keeping our oceans clean.",2014-05-04T05:41:26.242580,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'CA', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Orange Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Seal Beach', 'streetAddress': '593 Laguna Pl', 'postalCode': '90740', 'formattedAddress': '593 Laguna Pl, Seal Beach, CA 90740'}, 'coords': [-118.096965, 33.744807]}",6c0Ns4XKSLqfzhLSON8Wjg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-07-26T00:34:00.000Z,12605-137,ushahidi,"521 Laguna Pl., Seal Beach, CA","[{'name': 'Retention - Downspout Re-direct', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Permeability - Healthy Living Soil', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Permeability - Permeable Hardscape', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Retention - Sponge Gardens', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Conservation - Mulch', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Conservation - Plants', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:30:00.663255,United States,CA,Orange Co.,Seal Beach,"593 Laguna Pl, Seal Beach, CA 90740",90740,593 Laguna Pl,"{'adminArea3': 'CA', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Orange Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Seal Beach', 'streetAddress': '593 Laguna Pl', 'postalCode': '90740', 'formattedAddress': '593 Laguna Pl, Seal Beach, CA 90740'}","[-118.096965, 33.744807]",33.744807,-118.096965,Retention - Downspout Re-direct,Permeability - Healthy Living Soil,Permeability - Permeable Hardscape,en
2014-05-09 19:28:30.356307,"Chennai-based daily newspaper The Hindu ran a story on July 25 that contains the story of a woman named Um Firas, who says she witnessed naked women used as human shields in Homs. 

Now living in Mafraq, Jordan, Um Firas said: “I saw maybe 100 women stripped naked and used as human shields, forced to walk on all sides of the army tanks during the fighting. When their tanks rolled back into the Alawite neighborhood, the women disappeared with them.”

She did not state when this occurred but told the paper she left Homs more than a year ago. 

Another report on our map (from the Toronto Star) also talks about women being used as human shields and raped in front of tanks in Homs in March: https://womenundersiegesyria.crowdmap.com/reports/view/182. And this YouTube video mentions that women were allegedly used as human shields in Al Huswayieh, south of Homs, in January: https://womenundersiegesyria.crowdmap.com/reports/view/151.

Um Firas told The Hindu that she is concerned for her teenage daughter, who spent time in the sun in Syria to darken her skin make herself less desirable in order to prevent rape. “She told me, ‘If I turn black, the shabiha [pro-government militia] might not want to rape me,” she said. “They were targeting women. Iranian and Hezbollah fighters came into our neighborhood with their swords drawn. The women they found, they raped. They burned our homes.”

The dates of the reported sexualized violence are unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:24:10.070979,,"{'addressComponents': {'streetAddress': '5', 'adminArea1': 'Syria', 'formattedAddress': '5, Syria'}, 'coords': [36.71817, 34.733879]}",xwAS78LZRK6bumDiQrjCpA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-07-25T19:15:00.000Z,34369-235,ushahidi,Woman says she witnessed women stripped and used as human shields,"[{'name': '2GF.

2014-05-09 19:07:43.129270,"The ideology of Seats2meet.com

""We are transforming to a new era 'The Society3.0. A new order of people is presenting itself. It may still be an undercurrent, but maybe that is the best way to grow. These Society3.0 citizens cannot and will not deal with the thinking of the establishment anymore. They want to add value in their work and life in a significantly different way, namely by creating 'value' instead of 'growth'. 

We think these global citizens – who are increasing in number daily – are the pillars supporting Society3.0. Hundreds of millions of people of the world move around without restraints, literally unbounded, across borders all over our world. Sometimes they do this physically, but more often they do so digitally through out the Internet: the World Wide Web. These people of the world are no longer bound to old organizations. They have organized themselves in virtual social networks. They have started to create value in a different way. They do not work according to a formal organizational structure. They guide themselves. They are themselves. Their social connections show great creative vitality and unleash an enormous amount of energy. From within their self-awareness they respect the individuality of anybody. People of the world of Society30 are not after personal enrichment at the expense of others. They share; they are prepared to do a lot for someone else, without always expecting a monetary reward. They reinvent society and create all kind of new, fair and sustainable business models. 

We think it is both exciting and fun to be such a person, a Knowmad of the world of Society 3.0.

Seats2meet.com wants to play an active role in that world!""

We have gotten to the point where we have a global network of skywatchers that all use a ""Spray Day"" hashtag that looks like this for today: #SprayDay15July2013 This type of dating system began last November, so we have not made it through an entire year using it yet. Folks have been amazing at noting these days, with 149 photos tagged on March 5 and 161 photos tagged April 7. The only bumps in the road we hit were in June and July which we decided to spell out even though all other months get a 3 letter abbreviation. At this point it's too late to correct it, so we have gone with the 4 letter flow. Below are examples for each month for the rest of the year: #SprayDay1Aug2013 #SprayDay1Sep2013 #SprayDay1Oct2013 #SprayDay1Nov2013 #SprayDay1Dec2013 The rules for tagging are simple… 1. Only tag when there is visible Chemtrail activity 2. Don't tag on clear days. (Use the #clearDay tag) 3. Always look at and ""like"" the photos of that day so you can see where else spraying is occurring and support other skywatchers! We need your help!

2014-05-09 19:30:12.923845,"Lesson 1: by @Atlantic_Skywatch How to Spot Chemtrails #Chemtrails come in many shapes and sizes. This photo is a great example of how the trails can slowly change their shape and morph into either a ""cloud"" or a #chemHaze that fills the sky above you. The way these trails change seems to depend most on the amount of wind in the Troposhpere (0-7 miles up) and the Stratosphere (8-30 miles up). All airplanes travel between these two zones. There are some days where the trails can hold their linear shape for hours and other days that start to drift immediately, so it's important to study the sky every day to see what is going on and if/how these trails are reacting up there. I say it's important because 99% of the people around you have no idea that the pretty sunset you are watching is filled with only synthetic clouds that came from airplanes, but if you know the tell tale signs, you'll see right through the charade.

2014-05-09 19:30:14.109024,"#NoFilter. This disgustingly thick chemtrail lingered in the sky for so long over Jersey, a massive eyesore lingering in plain sight just leaking it's poison into the sky. Watching this trail spread was crazy, it was constantly growing, and was easily visible to see it leeching off into the sky in thin wisps falling from the trail. The ""cloud"" above it is also an aged trail, massive in size, slowly spreading to take away the natural beauty mother earth should be providing us with. Tonight was a complete bombardment on the area. These white-collared devils running the show are scientifically attacking us on a daily basis, soft killing you, me and everyone we know. This is fact. It's in the water you drink, it's in the food you eat, it's in the medicine that's supposedly curing you and its in air you breathe. Its all hidden in plain view! LOOKUP its so obvious that these are not clouds, and it is aboslutely no coincidence that heavy metal levels in air, water and soil are all sky rocketing, it's no coincidence that Autism rates are going up and up! This is a scientific cleptocratic genocidal demonic fascist communistic technocratic authoritarian group of criminals claiming to be YOUR leaders and they are signing you and your family up for an insanely evil agenda that they obsessively push forward every single day. Amerika has been conquered and the world is in the hands of Corrupt politicians, and mentally sick International Bankers. The natural world we live in has become a business and they're expecting us to fall back, ignore the truth and party our lives away to our FEMA sponsored coffins, well it's not gonna happen. The idea of revolution is spreading like wildfire and the seed of renaissance is planted ready to explode into a forest of peace. The world is hungry for Equality, Justice, Truth and Love and we the People of planet Earth far outnumber the round table of greedy shit heads against us. WakeUp people, we the awakened are waiting on you, and to the Elite, it's only a matter of time. Truth is spreading. emoji

2014-05-09 19:31:48.026523,"The Great Lakes Commons Map (GLCM) is a collaborative map of the Great Lakes in order to transition them into a shared commons. The idea was founded by Paul Baines during the winter of 2012, with the map going public later in May. Just over a year later, it is now a registered Ontario non-profit and ready for new investments and development.

The Vision of the GLCM is to grow deeper connections between the bioregion and its inhabitants through information, discussion, and story. 

The Mission of the GLCM is to put place first. Issues in agriculture, energy, urbanization, treaties, public health, climate, manufacturing, trade, consumerism, recreation, governance, public space, and transportation all impact the Great Lakes. Place-based awareness, sharing, and organizing are the best methods for defending and restoring these waters because place is where these issues intersect with home. Adopting a commons approach deepens this work. 

A commons is a shared agreement between people about gifts from the past and duties for the future. Used by all and owned by no one, the Great Lakes will only thrive as living systems when they are seen and treated as a commons. The GLCM gathers and organizes our gifts in technology, culture, and curiosity to multiply the parts beyond their sum through limitless collaboration and a shared vision.",2014-05-04T06:09:29.017387,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Toronto', 'adminArea5': 'Toronto', 'postalCode': 'M5G', 'formattedAddress': 'Toronto, ON M5G, Canada'}, 'coords': [-79.383184, 43.653226]}",FWRXijsGQyexUHhMLsM70g,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-07-10T01:55:00.000Z,49477-58,ushahidi,Great Lakes Commons Map,"[{'name': 'Education', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Partnerships', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Environment', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Health', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:31:48.026523,Canada,ON,Toronto,Toronto,"Toronto, ON M5G, Canada",M5G,,"{'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Toronto', 'adminArea5': 'Toronto', 'postalCode': 'M5G', 'formattedAddress': 'Toronto, ON M5G, Canada'}","[-79.383184, 43.653226]",43.653226,-79.383184,Education,Partnerships,Environment,en

2014-05-09 19:28:41.095846,"icecairo is a not-for-profit, community-powered green tech innovation hub. We work together to solve environmental and social challenges using the brilliance of the icecairo community, and to turn these challenges in to green businesses. By convening workshops around specific challenges, the icecairo community is able to identify solutions. We then use our fablab's rapid prototyping machinery to create and evolve these solutions into real world green products. These products can then be sold by sustainable businesses, powered by and employing young Egyptians. In this way icecairo embodies it's mission: green tech innovation for youth job creation.

icecairo offers two incredible spaces for innovation, collaboration and entrepreneurship. Our physical hub (the downtown hub) is a space where people can co-work, attend / run events, and use the fablab to make / hack ""green"" products. Our online hub is a collection of platforms: a website, a wiki, a mapping system, an e-learning platform and an e-commerce site, all designed to maximise collaboration within the icecairo community.

Together with our partners in civil society, the private sector, government and academia, icecairo believes it can turn almost any challenge in to a sustainable business opportunity.",2014-05-04T05:26:08.364908,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'Cairo', 'streetAddress': '32 Mohamed Sabry Abo Alam Street', 'adminArea1': 'Egypt', 'formattedAddress': '32 Mohamed Sabry Abo Alam Street, Cairo, Cairo, Egypt', 'adminArea5': 'Cairo'}, 'coords': [31.240358, 30.046648]}",B-jciZ7rRnODGJzP4qayiw,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-07-08T10:25:00.000Z,32383-117,ushahidi,icecairo,"[{'name': 'Technology Hubs', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'HackerSpaces', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:28:41.095846,Egypt,Cairo,,Cairo,"32 Mohamed Sabry Abo Alam Street, Cairo, Cairo, Egypt",,32 Mohamed Sabry Abo Alam Street,"{'adminArea3': 'Cairo', 'streetAddress': '32 Mohamed Sabry Abo Alam Street', 'adminArea1': 'Egypt', 'formattedAddress': '32 Mohamed Sabry Abo Alam Street, Cairo, Cairo, Egypt', 'adminArea5': 'Cairo'}","[31.240358, 30.046648]",30.046648,31.240358,Technology Hubs,HackerSpaces,,en

We approached the zoo with our plan to plant a garden and with a few months of work and plans we were able to see it through. Special thanks to the zoo staff, volunteers who prepped the area, cut away dead foliage, dug holes, spread organic mulch, raked and planted. Our awesome rain barrel is from RainLife Rain Barrels in Lake Worth.

So 6% of our days were completely clear of visible chemtrailing and we had a potential high of 93.3% spray days if you assume they were spraying on the cloudy/rainy days (which is very often the case). So far this year 67.2% of days have seen chemtrail activity.

2014-05-09 19:31:48.862269,"In November 2012, WhyDev launched a pilot program providing a peer coaching service for aid workers. The pilot was financed by a crowdfunding campaign run earlier in the year. A total of 312 aid workers from around the world registered to participate and were matched with a peer coach. 

After matching participants using software developed specifically for the pilot, WhyDev provided ongoing support. We also created and provided specific resources, including peer coaching guidelines, developed in partnership with Shana Montesol Johnson, an executive career coach. We received encouraging responses throughout the pilot period, both via social media and email. 

A snapshot of the Pilot Program and results: 

- 312 aid workers from around the world participated and were matched with a peer coach.
- The average peer coach is a female expat aid worker, aged 26-35 years-old, has a postgraduate Masters degree and less than 5 years of work experience in international development.
- 73 participants responded to the evaluation survey. 
- Overall, 43% of respondents were satisfied with the pilot program and 28% indicated that they were unsatisfied. 
- When asked what  the ONE significant thing they got out of the peer coaching sessions, respondents indicated a range of benefits from validation, reflexive practice and clarification to having a ‘new colleague’, expectation management and feeling less stressed and isolated.",2014-05-04T06:09:50.734858,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'NSW', 'adminArea1': 'Australia', 'adminArea5': 'Sydney', 'streetAddress': '343 George St', 'postalCode': '2000', 'formattedAddress': '343 George St, Sydney, NSW 2000'}, 'coords': [151.20699, -33.867487]}",qiM1WBFSS_66WdWM7MzSDg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-06-26T00:11:00.000Z,49477-48,ushahidi,WhyDev: Peer Coaching Pilot Program,"[{'name': 'Other', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:31:48.862269,Australia,NSW,,Sydney,"343 George St, Sydney, NSW 2000",2000,343 George St,"{'adminArea3': 'NSW', 'adminArea1': 'Australia', 'adminArea5': 'Sydney', 'streetAddress': '343 George St', 'postalCode': '2000', 'formattedAddress': '343 George St, Sydney, NSW 2000'}","[151.20699, -33.867487]",-33.867487,151.20699,Other,,,en

2014-05-09 19:29:59.810006,"Last winter during a heavy rain we had an issue with one of our buildings where water was running across our property and carrying mud into the storm drain.  After a visit from a city worker, I was prompted to take action.

Just as we were thinking about irrigation and planting, I stumbled upon a photo of an OFG on the Huntington Beach Chamber website. I called Marilee Movius at the Chamber to see if she could give me any information about it. She was so helpful; she explained to me about the Surfrider Foundation and referred me to Greg Goran from Green Scene Sustainable Landscapes, and the Ocean Friendly Gardens Chair for the HB/Seal Beach chapter. Greg met with me several times, gave me advice and guidance on soil prep, California native and drought tolerant plants as well as explaining “Conservation, Permeability, and Retention.”
After we amended the soil with organic compost, we contoured a dry creek bed from our downspout to the end of the property.  We then purchased some drought tolerant grasses and ground covers as well as some Calif. Natives.  Marilee and Greg then recruited some volunteers and helped plant them! (thank you guys).  We also dug a large hole 3 ft. wide and 3 ft. deep that we filled with gravel to act as a catch basin, and built a retention berm with boulders and larger rocks below that to retain any additional water from leaving the site.  We stuck with a simple plant pallet of some Agave attenuatas, Senecio serpens, and Pennesetum, while all around the edge we planted with blue fescue, creeping thyme, and other ground covers to ensure any water that does leave is cleaned and silt free.
I am very pleased with the outcome and I am already planning on doing more of this. In addition to the environmental benefits it is attractive, I will save on my water bill and I don’t have to pay a gardener!

from the newspaper article linked below:

""For a fourth consecutive year, Central Elgin hoisted a Blue Flag over Main Beach on Tuesday in Port Stanley.

There were no long-winded speeches, just to-the-point answers to reporters' questions.

But that doesn't mean the municipality doesn't boast about the international environmental accreditation that the flag represents.

“It's on our website and in our advertising,” Deputy Mayor David Marr said.

The flag means the beach has met 32 detailed criteria set out by the Denmark-based Foundation for Environmental Education, covering for environmental education and information; water quality; environmental management; and safety and services.

But for the average beachgoer crowding on a sunny and hot summer holiday weekend to the hugely-popular attraction, it means one thing.

“They can enjoy the beach and the water in a safe environment,” Marr said.

Main Beach is one of 3,850 beaches and marinas flying a Blue Flag in more than 48 countries.

It also is the only Blue Flag beach on Lake Erie.""

The activist's cellmate at the Military Intelligence branch said that at some point she’d shared a cell with both young wives (aged 18 and 20) during their four-day detention, during which time they recounted the attack. Both they and their husbands, who were FSA soldiers, had been arrested by two shabiha and were put on a bus for transport to a detention facility. En route, the two men beat and restrained the husbands while they attacked their wives, one of whom was pregnant, the activist said.

The women were forced to perform oral sex, their cellmate told the activist, and the shabiha raped the woman who was not pregnant. They “raped the breasts” of the pregnant woman, according to the activist, and ejaculated on her. 

After the sexual assault, the women and their husbands were taken to an unidentified house and held for a brief period before being moved to the Military Intelligence branch, the activist said.

But opponents to the project say that even if the parking lot is underground, the 30-meter, hundred-year-old pine trees with their long roots would not survive, the vibrations from the drilling would harm the ruins of one of Lebanon’s oldest known churches, the construction period would cause tremendous noise pollution, and once the project does reach completion they worry about congestion and roadblocks in the mainly residential neighborhood’s narrow streets.",2014-05-04T06:08:19.534386,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'Beirut', 'adminArea1': 'Lebanon', 'adminArea4': 'Beirut', 'adminArea5': 'Beirut', 'streetAddress': 'Rue 66', 'formattedAddress': 'Rue 66, Beirut, Lebanon'}, 'coords': [35.525943, 33.893448]}",XoQS2gtYTKO3vXzcGh38iw,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-06-16T09:42:00.000Z,48630-12,ushahidi,Jesuit Garden underground parking,"[{'name': 'Public Garden', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'At risk', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:31:45.176200,Lebanon,Beirut,Beirut,Beirut,"Rue 66, Beirut, Lebanon",,Rue 66,"{'adminArea3': 'Beirut', 'adminArea1': 'Lebanon', 'adminArea4': 'Beirut', 'adminArea5': 'Beirut', 'streetAddress': 'Rue 66', 'formattedAddress': 'Rue 66, Beirut, Lebanon'}","[35.525943, 33.893448]",33.893448,35.525943,Public Garden,At risk,,en

“I participated in a demonstration in east Ghota [in the Damascus countryside] during last Ramadan [July/August 2012]. I was shot and taken to a private hospital for treatment but security forces moved me to the Mezzeh Military Hospital in Damascus. I had a lower limb fracture and an injury to the nerves causing paralysis of that limb.

“I was moved to the prisoners holding area in the hospital, which has 14 beds, each has 4 prisoners, all chained, blindfolded, and naked. I stayed there six months. Every day at 3 a.m. a few wounded got executed and new ones admitted. Total executions during my stay reached 1,700 in my holding area, which was #215 and controlled by the security personnel of Palestine Security Branch.

“There was a First Class Private whose name was Khaldoun, but he called himself Azrael, the name of the angel of death. He would beat the patients to death. I witnessed and suffered from different methods of torture, beating with a metal tube, suffocation with military boot or belt, IV shots that kills, burning of the beard, cigarettes burns in the ear and nose, repeated whipping until the patient passed out, kept naked in wintertime with the windows open, and torturers would step on our wounds or burns with their military boots. There were no toilets and we had to urinate and defecate on the beds. Sometimes we were forced to eat our excretions.”

2014-05-09 19:31:47.938696,"PAGIR was created precisely for the purpose of creating a just, equitable and inclusive society at one of the remotest, challenging and beautiful places on the earth, Ladakh. PAGIR is a rights movement working to create a society that is inclusive and free of prejudices. Set up in March 2007, most of the members of PAGIR are disabled of have family members who are disabled or have experienced disability in different forms in the society and care to work towards it. 

PAGIR believes that it is a matter of rights that disabled member persons should be a part of the mainstream society and access equal opportunities that exist for other non-disabled persons of our society. Our focus is therefore not to create specialized services for disabled persons that are potentially isolating in nature. Instead we work with the government system, NGOs and other community structures to create an environment that ensures inclusion of disabled persons in mainstream activities. Our work involves large scale mobilization and advocacy to: a) help implement government policies and ensure that services reach disabled people, b) create mass awareness amongst people regarding rights issue, c) promote disabled people’s participation in the social and political processes of the region, d) to empower disabled people economically, so that they contribute to the economic development of the region.

Along-side, we have an enterprise as well, namely Jungwa Shrungskyob, meaning the protection of the four elements of nature, is also one of the social ventures of PAGIR with the main motive of working towards the conservation of nature and having environment friendly processes established in the Ladakh region of India. In this the disabled artisans of Ladakh turn waste materials into craft and hence-wise contribute in creating a better environment and setting an unmatched example. We also have our second enterprise by the name of ""Himalaya on Wheels"" which promotes and works towards making responsible and accessible tourism a reality in Ladakh.

Line 9 is an aging oil pipeline owned by Enbridge Inc. that runs through some of the most densely populated parts of Canada.

Right now, the 38-year-old pipeline carries conventional oil and runs across Ontario and Quebec. As part of a larger plan to export tar sands oil east through Canada and the U.S., Enbridge recently applied to reverse Line 9 and has asked for permission for the line to carry heavy crude, which could include tar sands oil. Once that tar sands oil reaches Montreal, it is expected that a second pipeline will be reversed to carry the oil south to Portland, Maine for export.

Enbridge’s Line 9 proposal carries many risks, but few rewards for communities along the pipeline’s route.

2014-05-09 19:29:26.581019,"From the article linked below (see article for full story):

Hamilton 350 has filed a policy complaint against the Hamilton police services board for accepting $44,410 in donations from Enbridge Pipelines Inc. CBC reports, “The money was given in two separate installments — $34,910 for a new ATV unit and $9,500 for mapping and GPS equipment in 2010. 

Protesters are fighting Enbridge’s plan to reverse the oil flow of the line 9B pipeline which runs from Montreal through Westover, in rural Hamilton. They say the flow reversal could raise the risk of a spill into places like the Beverly Swamp in the headwaters of Spencer Creek, Hamilton’s largest watershed. In their letter of complaint, the group said, “(The) question of principle is the public perception of favouritism on the part of the HPS on behalf of a private corporation.” Don McLean, a Hamilton 350 coordinator, says, “It’s inappropriate. This is a public police force and it should be funded by the public. If they’re of the view that municipalities need additional money, they could raise it in taxes. The appropriate way for these costs to be covered is the taxation process.” Their media release also notes, “While Hamilton’s funds went toward a GPS system and ATV’s, Belleville used their funds for a new mobile command center and the OPP splurged on night vision goggles.”

The CBC article adds, “Police spokesperson Catherine Martin declined to comment on the complaint itself, saying it is a Police Services Board issue. The police services board did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Martin said the complaint would likely go to the Office of the Independent Police Review Director.”

“I was raped many times,” she said. “After the third rape, I could not move at all and started bleeding. They just left me on the floor. I stayed imprisoned for 100 days, tortured and raped repeatedly, and transferred to five different centers. I witnessed the arrest and torture of many others. I became close to four girls in Adra [Prison] detention center in Reef Damascus. It was like repeated death.”

Amal fled to Jordan in early 2013, where she met a woman named Um Zaher, who is helping her cope and who gave her the name Amal, which means “hope,” according to the channel.

Amal's 70-year-old father cried during the interview, saying, “My responsibility in front of God as a father is to protect her. I failed to do that.""

2014-05-09 19:28:30.267346,"A video posted on YouTube on June 2 shows what appears to be a half-naked young woman unmoving in the middle of a street and under heavy fire as men try to rescue her. Narration alleges that the woman was raped and tortured and left to die as a trap for men trying to help her. The title of the video is “Hearing is in no way equal to witnessing. Witnessing will make you wish you had died before you witnessed.” Here is a translation of the narrative overlaying the video:

“The regime forces arrested, raped, and tortured a young woman. They took her child and left her almost naked on the Mid-Circulatory Road in Jobar, Damascus, a frontline area of fighting with the opposition, after they shot at her feet to cripple her so she cannot walk. They wanted to use her as a trap for the FSA fighters who tried relentlessly to save her life. 

“As they were beating her child, the young woman was moving in response to his cries, unable to do anything else.

“The FSA wanted to save her, but the regime snipers were shooting during the attempts. Four volunteers went under the snipers and were killed without succeeding.

“The young woman died after 10 hours of physical and psychological agony on the ‘road of death.’

“Hisham Al-Kurdi was the last hero who was martyred attempting to save her. He was from the Alsalhia Freedom Fighters battalion.

“This is the facts of what takes place in Syria every day, and the world continues in its deadly silence!”
 
The date the reported rape is unknown.

2014-05-09 19:29:24.691400,"The Milwaukee Water Commons project has been undertaken to surface broader leadership, community partnerships, and momentum for fresh work regarding Milwaukee’s water future.  Milwaukee has the ingredients to become a leader in freshwater issues, but it will require a different orientation and pattern of community leadership than is currently at the forefront of the city’s water conversations.

Our inquiry process explored the basis for an alternative focus. Building from a commons perspective, one that seeks solutions of shared benefit, shared responsibility and shared stewardship, we engaged 50 community leaders from a range of sectors (the arts, public health, law, urban agriculture, academia, faith, K-12 education, business, and water professionals) in a set of in-depth interviews and two large group working sessions.

We found that not only were we able to activate a circle of leaders around Milwaukee’s water future but that underlying their interest were some shared and motivating beliefs about water and our responsibility for it that we could work from as foundational orientation.  We have drafted a set of common first principles: 

1. Water is an essential element for all life on Earth. 
2. Water belongs to no one and cannot be owned.
3. We recognize our inheritance of the Great Lakes; they have nurtured our ancestors and shaped us as a people and as a community.  They continue to sustain us.
4. We have a responsibility to protect and pass on clean and abundant fresh water to future generations.
5. Decisions about the care and responsibility for our waters must involve all of us.

We have begun working on five interlocking strategies to lift up and live these principles here in Milwaukee:  

1. Activating Citizens-We are partnering at seven neighborhood sites strategically chosen to develop local involvement with water issues and stewardship.  We are working to expand beyond the familiar circle of water experts and to explore partnerships within the arts, the faith community, public health,  recreation and urban farmers to name a few.  Our inaugural water leadership training will begin this spring, bringing together residents from our diverse neighborhoods.  Each team will then engage in a water related project that will benefit their neighborhood.  We will culminate the year with a lakeshore event calling attention to the preciousness of our waters. 
 
2. Fostering Collaboration in the Community-There is a great deal of work happening in Milwaukee.  Our goal is to seek out synergies and foster collaboration among and beyond established water groups.  Partner organizations will work with neighborhood groups to support their water initiatives and to provide educational, scientific, and artistic support.  

3. Leveraging Existing Capacity and Resources for Local Solution Making-One of the most important connections is the interface between the University of Wisconsin’s School of Freshwater Science and the Community.  We will explore ways to better leverage and integrate the research expertise and capacity of the school in local policy and community water challenges.  

4. Developing a New Public Narrative of Milwaukee as a Water City-The power of narrative to shape the public conversation is increasingly recognized in social change circles.  We need a story that puts community and water stewardship at the center of the Milwaukee landscape.  We will work across several platforms-social media, websites, the arts, events and two documentary films to tell our story and to document the emergence of new community water leadership.  

5. Linking Milwaukee to the Great Lakes Commons and Bio region-The work we are doing in Milwaukee-from organizing citizen leadership to fostering collaboration and defining a new narrative is breaking ground.  We stand to gain, to learn, and to share new learning as we progress.  Ultimately we need our local water efforts to encourage bold citizen leadership across the bioregion and to grow a network of Great Lakes Commons leaders that can draw strength from working together.

2014-05-09 19:29:25.829250,"Calling all shoreline stewards and beach monitors - to start using this Commons Map.

In the past I noticed abnormal flies on fish carcasses at beaches on the south shore and on Main Duck Is, Lake Ontario. Each time I posted a note on my Lake Ontario Log at my website and asked if others had seen anything similar. (This was posted in August 2011 - see link below)

No other wingless fly reports came in. At other times I've noticed unusual numbers of either a single species of dead fish on the beach or large numbers of varied dead fish species. Then there was the obvious outbreak of botulism in the fall of 2006.

As the summer season begins, again I issue a call to all you pebble pickers and beach walkers to post reports of unusual sightings. Believe me, some of the scientists studying the lake are interested in what you find. I had a researcher ask for follow up on an unusual algae bloom  I reported last spring. 

It's called “citizen science” and research is benefiting from all those smart phones with cameras that can snap photos and tag a GPS location on the image.  And if you see something absolutely wonderful it is also worth note. Seen a sturgeon? Let the fisheries folk know. Or the two sand hill cranes went over our stretch of shore yesterday - very cool birds! Were they looking for possible nesting sites? Nature is under siege but there is still resilience in the system. Let's keep an eye on things. 

Involvement is key.

The system orchestrates the traffic through a distributed routing algorithm in an optimal way. Ordinary navigation systems divert traffic jams onto smaller streets after they occurred, whereas nunav actively prevents traffic jams. This is possible because nunav reserves timeslots for cars on the streets. With this technique, nunav knows the position of participating cars for any given point in time, including the future.

The heart of the system is an optimized graph traversal algorithm that calculates shortest paths in a matter of milliseconds. The implementation includes many heuristics in order to reduce the complexity of calculating a route to nearly linear time.

2014-05-09 19:29:25.999626,"Lone Pine Resources, which wanted to frack for gas under the St. Lawrence River, has threatened to sue Canada under the North American Free Trade Agreement. The company is demanding $250 million in compensation for Quebec’s moratorium, which it says violates Lone Pine’s “right” to frack!

We shouldn’t have to pay to protect ourselves and our environment. Communities, not private firms, should have the final say on fracking and other projects that threaten water sources, the environment and public health – and there should be no penalty for saying “no.”

We need your help to get Lone Pine to drop their challenge. Help us invite 5,000 people to this event to take these three actions:

1. Tell Lone Pine to drop their challenge by signing this petition: http://canadians.org/action/petition/index.php

Each time we collect 1,000 signatures we'll send a letter to Lone Pine.

2014-05-09 19:33:04.352386,"Low-cost affordable housing is one of the key factors in the fight against poverty and social exclusion. It is not just about putting a roof over someone's head. Academic research proves that access to a clean and stable home implicates an improvement in security, health and education.

Moladi, an award winning South African based company, established in 1986, makes low cost housing accessible to low-income people through innovative and eco-friendly technology, creating employment.

The Moladi Low Cost Housing System consists of a reusable and recyclable plastic formwork mold, which is filled with stone-less concrete and a special concrete additive. This additive ensures that, once the mortar is set, the formwork can be removed - and reused up to 50 times.
The brick-less walls can withstand all types of weather and is earthquake resistant. The formwork is lightweight allowing easy transportation. Due to the simplicity in design and the repetitive application scheme, construction costs can be reduced significantly. The Moladi model is not only cost-effective but fast, to. The walls of a house can be completed within one day.

With the motto ""Train the unemployed to build for the homeless"" Moladi combines construction with economic development. The company offers training locally for the unemployed thereby creating jobs and empowering the community as a whole. Due to the simplicity of the approach, construction techniques and skills can be transferred in a short time. In this way, the communities benefit from affordable shelter and skilled entrepreneurs (in the area of low-cost housing) at the same time. Moladi's success in over 20 countries shows that affordable housing is an important key in finding solutions to promoting security and alleviating poverty.

How to bring decent low cost housing to poor communities? It was Dr. Ernst Friedrich Schumacher who coined this term ""Small is Beautiful"". The economist and philosopher wanted to stress that small-scale technologies are the ones needed in the fight against poverty. These solutions have great advantages: they can be implemented with local resources and skills and they are affordable - which makes them tools that empower people to help themselves.

The impact of appropriate technology becomes particularly noticeable when innovative solutions are used and promoted by social entrepreneurs who put social impact at the heart of their business. The combination of low-cost technology and social entrepreneurship can have far-reaching implications for thousands of lives. Creating jobs, stimulating ownership confidence and the spirit of innovation - this is what social businesses are looking for.

Appropriate technical solutions, such as low cost housing, improve life quality and can give the initial push for development.

2014-05-09 19:33:04.443065,"SANKALPA, a non-profit organization, founded in 2011, started a good initiative in Social Service. We have developed an online system to keep the voluntary blood donors detail in an online database. It makes a sense that online services have now been extended to blood donation in Nepal. We want to make sure that people around Nepal suffer no more in case they need blood to save the lives of their near and dear ones.

We have developed an online system branded as ""HamroBlood"" through which we will maintain a regular contact with people wishing to donate blood and send the potential blood donors to the concerned transfusion centers immediately in case of their blood group is required. The system will also help in keeping blood stocks at transfusion centers.

Our efforts will be a great help to the poor and unprivileged. We provide a SMS short code [3001] and our direct numbers to every hospitals and transfusion centers so that they can contact us (SANKALPA) through SMS or calls to our numbers to get our help in case any patient requires blood.

The only objective of the project ""HamroBlood"" is to maximize the possibilities of getting blood when required.

SANKALPA, is a team of young and enthusiastic students who have started to think simple things differently and are trying to make a difference in the contemporary scenario of Social Service in Nepal. There is large number of pints needed daily but the donation programs are only organized rarely in the major cities. This makes a kind of scarcity of blood always. In this scenario, SANKALPA, have come up with an unique idea to provide blood when needed. This is completely free of cost and without so much mental torture for the patient's relatives or family members. But the patient's party has to pay for the tests to the transfusion center or blood bank which has to be done before the transfusion.

There is lack of awareness among people who is able to donate blood physically but is never ready to donate mentally. So we (SANKALPA) are going to organize a National Level Awareness Campaign so as to make people aware as well as mentally prepared to donate blood focusing mainly on first time donors. Everything costs something, even the time. The project till date is dependent upon our own pocket money but how long and how far will we continue this project with this limited pocket money of ours is the major question. Definitely not for so long. So we felt the utmost need to approach you for your support to continue this project and make it a sustainable project in long run. To which, at least we should be able to pay for the time and effort of our volunteers and be able to pay for the juice and the fruits provided to the blood donors after donation. I hope, we will be able to pay for the juice and fruits for the donors after we receive some fund from this campaign, and of course! We will be able to organize a national level campaign and aware people around Nepal.",2014-05-04T06:09:43.881263,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'Gandakī', 'adminArea1': 'Nepal', 'adminArea4': 'Kaski', 'formattedAddress': 'Namarjung, Nepal', 'adminArea5': 'Namarjung'}, 'coords': [84.124008, 28.394857]}",s2evFk0QTlS5oT68F9dtvw,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-05-10T11:56:00.000Z,49477-27,ushahidi,SANKALPA: HamroBlood - An Online Community of Volunteer Blood Donors in Nepal,"[{'name': 'Volunteerism', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Health', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:33:04.443065,Nepal,Gandakī,Kaski,Namarjung,"Namarjung, Nepal",,,"{'adminArea3': 'Gandakī', 'adminArea1': 'Nepal', 'adminArea4': 'Kaski', 'formattedAddress': 'Namarjung, Nepal', 'adminArea5': 'Namarjung'}","[84.124008, 28.394857]",28.394857,84.124008,Volunteerism,Health,,en

She subsequently underwent surgery in Syria to remove a bullet in her spine. Now she’s paralyzed and will not walk again, according to doctors at SAMS.

“She says, ‘I was injured,’” Abdullah said. “She doesn’t say, 'I was raped.'” But Abdullah said she knows through “sources” that the girl was raped in the attack.

The girl and her family, who now live in Amman, were trying to flee Homs when the family was stopped at an army checkpoint. Soldiers pulled the girl from the car and attacked her, Abdullah said.

“Her family is shattered,” she said.

Other girls Abdullah treats at the clinic have told her that they witnessed mass rapes in Syria. 

The date and location of the reported rape is unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:24:14.593159,,"{'addressComponents': {'streetAddress': '5', 'adminArea1': 'Syria', 'formattedAddress': '5, Syria'}, 'coords': [36.71817, 34.733879]}",jEk-Ss7NTCy1LXi51fGBXw,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-05-06T20:35:00.000Z,34369-205,ushahidi,"Amman clinic treating girl, 13, allegedly raped by army then shot","[{'name': '3GF.

The Toronto Star reports, “Crude oil from western Canada could soon flow across the Greater Toronto Area toward Montreal, according to a notice filed by Enbridge Inc. with the National Energy Board. The notice comes as a study conducted by conservation areas in the GTA warns that a pipeline break could have a ’significant’ effect on drinking water. …The study modeled the effect of breaks where pipelines cross streams and rivers that flow into Lake Ontario near drinking water intakes. The spills in the model would mean that contaminants would exceed drinking water standards at the water plant intakes, the study says. …Studies of threats to drinking water quality were ordered under the Ontario Clean Water Act, passed in 2006 following the Walkerton water disaster. …Adam Scott of Environmental Defence says that the pipeline application, along with the water report, should prompt local governments to take more notice of the issue.”

“Line 9 currently flows westward. Enbridge has received permission to reverse the flow on the portion of the line between Sarnia and a terminal near Hamilton, to bring western Canadian crude oil to Ontario. Enbridge has now notified the energy board that it will apply by year’s end to reverse the flow of Hamilton-to-Montreal portion of the line. Environmental groups who appeared at an energy board hearing last spring said Enbridge’s ultimate plan is to use the line to ship oil sands crude eastward to Montreal, and then on to the Atlantic coast. …Although the new application will include permission to ship ‘heavy crude’, that does not include oil sands crude, (Enbridge spokesman Graham) White said. Nor does the application contemplate shipping oil to the Atlantic coast, he said. …While Enbridge says it has no plans to ship oil sands crude east, some observers, including former Bank of Canada governor David Dodge, have suggested shipping oil sands crude to the Atlantic coast, instead of south to Gulf of Mexico or west to the Pacific.”

A Bloomberg news report deepens concern that if Enbridge were to receive approval to ship oil to Montreal, they may then seek to revive the ‘Trailbreaker’ project and export through an existing 236-mile underground pipeline between Montreal and Portland (across Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom, and passing near Sebago Lake and over the Androscoggin River). In October 2011, that news service reported, “Enbridge is in talks with Valero Energy Corp. and other refiners about reversing the flow of a pipeline to ship Canadian crude to the U.S. East Coast, said Chief Executive Officer Patrick Daniel.” Environmental groups have stated that from Portland the bitumen could be loaded onto tankers and shipped along the eastern US coast and down to the Gulf of Mexico to refineries in Texas.

Former long-time Council of Canadians Board member Gordon Laxer recently wrote in the Edmonton Journal, “As B.C. opposition to oil pipelines rises, eyes turn east. …Certain advantages have been trumpeted by the likes of Derek Burney, who was chief of staff to Brian Mulroney and sits on the board of TransCanada Pipelines, and Eddie Goldenberg, who was chief of staff to Jean Chrétien. One example: the bitumen could flow over existing rights of way and have fewer regulatory hurdles.”

2014-05-09 19:28:31.156436,"Omar Al-Jeblawi, media spokesman for the Revolutionaries of Jableh, told WMC’s Women Under Siege that shabiha (plainclothes militia) members raped his cousin, who is 27 or 28 years old.

A week before the May 3 massacre in Banyias, Al-Jeblawi’s cousin was heading to Tartous when she was stopped at the first checkpoint near Baniyas. Men in civilian clothes took her to a cabin next to the checkpoint and raped her for about an hour while the others held her down.  They ripped her clothes and threw her out onto the highway, where a friend picked her up.

A few days before WMC’s Women Under Siege met with Al-Jeblawi, his cousin sent him a text message that said she was pregnant from the rape and that she had miscarried. Al-Jeblawi’s mother took his cousin to a doctor because she’s been hemorrhaging, he said. When she first began to feel signs of pregnancy before the bleeding began, he said, she started drinking castor oil, hoping to bring on a miscarriage. He speculated that she actually miscarried from the stress of witnessing her four brothers and four cousins killed at Baniyas.

“It’s very difficult,” Al-Jeblawi said. “She’s always sad. She’s always crying. She always feels like she’s lost something.”

Al-Jeblawi showed a photo of his cousin squatting near the dead bodies of her brothers just after they were killed in the massacre. His cousin said she’d hid in nearby fields during the killing but had heard sounds of shooting and rape.

When asked if his cousin is able to see a psychologist, Al-Jeblawi said: “There’s no psychologist for her to see. In our condition, once you start seeing more than one doctor, you start hurting more. After the medical doctor, the family will help with psychology. In general there’s a shortage of these doctors. There are good ones in Latakia, but she has a phobia of checkpoints now.”

Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:24:21.397345,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea1': 'Syria', 'formattedAddress': 'Syria'}, 'coords': [35.940278, 35.182222]}",bb4R926NSYePHTwaX1rg1Q,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-04-26T00:30:00.000Z,34369-221,ushahidi,Activist says shabiha raped and impregnated his cousin near Baniyas,"[{'name': '3SF.

The Democrat and Chronicle in New York state has commented, “The risks (of fracking) may be substantial. Opponents point to the damage wastewater from the process could do were it to find its way into underground aquifers or the region’s Finger Lakes, which provide drinking water for hundreds of thousands, including in Rochester.” The Finger Lakes are located just south of Lake Ontario. Governor Mario Cuomo was on the cusp of approving fracking in New York state, but this decision has now been reportedly delayed for at least a year.

2014-05-09 19:07:44.835803,"The bioreactor façade at the BIQ house is in position and will be showcased for the first time on 23 March at the opening of the International Building Exhibition in Hamburg. 

After that, the integrated algae-based system will be put into full operational mode at an inauguration event for the media on 25 April.

The BIQ house will become the world’s first pilot project to showcase a bioreactive façade at the International Building Exhibition (IBA) in Hamburg on 23 March. With 200m² of integrated photo-bioreactors, this passive-energy house generates biomass and heat as renewable energy resources. At the same time, the system integrates additional functionality such as dynamic shading, thermal insulation and noise abatement, highlighting the full potential of this technology.

The microalgae used in the façades are cultivated in flat panel glass bioreactors measuring 2.5m x 0.7m. In total, 129 bioreactors have been installed on the south west and south east faces of the four-storey residential building. The heart of the system is the fully automated energy management centre where solar thermal heat and algae are harvested in a closed loop to be stored and used to generate hot water. 

The innovative façade system is the result of three years of research and development by Colt International based on a bio-reactor concept developed by SSC Ltd and design work led by Arup. Funding support came from the German Government’s ""ZukunftBau"" research initiative.",2014-05-04T04:49:28.670069,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'HH', 'adminArea1': 'Germany', 'adminArea4': 'Stadt Hamburg', 'adminArea5': 'Hamburg', 'streetAddress': '7 Rathausmarkt', 'postalCode': '20095', 'formattedAddress': '7 Rathausmarkt, 20095 Hamburg'}, 'coords': [9.993682, 53.551085]}",y45y1DHgSHWOxpjapqZpvg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-04-23T11:03:00.000Z,24670-158,ushahidi,Smart Building Bioreactive Facade Creates Energy,"[{'name': 'Cognitive Buildings', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Smart Grid', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:07:44.835803,Germany,HH,Stadt Hamburg,Hamburg,"7 Rathausmarkt, 20095 Hamburg",20095,7 Rathausmarkt,"{'adminArea3': 'HH', 'adminArea1': 'Germany', 'adminArea4': 'Stadt Hamburg', 'adminArea5': 'Hamburg', 'streetAddress': '7 Rathausmarkt', 'postalCode': '20095', 'formattedAddress': '7 Rathausmarkt, 20095 Hamburg'}","[9.993682, 53.551085]",53.551085,9.993682,Cognitive Buildings,Smart Grid,,en

2014-05-09 19:08:05.978462,"I got in from my Ennis trip Monday night around 8pm. In total, I spent over 12 hours on the Ennis area roads spread over 3 days. Pretty much all of the ""favorite usual"" spots were nearly void of bluebonnets or any wildflowers for that matter. Locations like Andrews RD and FM-813 were nothing like they were last year, but had a few nice spots if you walked along the extent of the field.  I was at Andrews RD early on Sunday morning and it was funny to see some people would stop at the middle of the field where hardly any blooms were. They would take a few photos, get in their car and drive right past the end of the field where it was the most dense with blooms. I did alert a few that I met while there.  Same thing on FM-813 on the west leg past the intersection with 879.  If you drive around the corner going west on FM-813, you might miss the nice spot on the east end of the field on the right.

Here were my top spots:

1. Andrews RD
2. Hornik RD (the red house and the old barn)
3. Creechville RD (1181)- between Hornik RD and Spence RD.
4. FM-813 west of FM-879

Grand Rapids is located on Lake Michigan. The Associated Press has reported, “Measurements taken in January show Lake Huron and Lake Michigan have reached their lowest ebb since record keeping began in 1918, and the lakes could set additional records over the next few months.” The significant impact of climate change on lake levels has been highlighted in studies by the International Joint Commission, the International Upper Great Lakes Study Board, the University of Minnesota Duluth’s Large Lakes Observatory, NASA, and the US Geographical Survey.

Milwaukee is located on Lake Michigan, just 100 miles along the shoreline from Whiting, Illinois. This year, the BP refinery in Whiting will begin refining more tar sands bitumen from Alberta. About 10 percent of its capacity (about 405,000 barrels a day) now comes from the tar sands. It is fed by the Enbridge pipeline that burst in July 2010 and spilled more than 23,000 barrels of crude oil - with the spill site including Talmadge Creek and a 48-kilometre length of the Kalamazoo River which connects to Lake Michigan. The refinery has its wastewaster treatment plant in Chicago, Illinois, also on Lake Michigan.

Saturday, April 13

Book Launch of book chronicling my 1000-mile hike touching all five Great Lakes in 2012. The book explores the geology, hydrology, and ecosystems of the Great Lakes. It also examines threats to these waters: invasive species, algae blooms, pollution, and destruction of wetlands.

In 2009, I walked all the way around Lake Michigan (the only Great Lake completely within the boundaries of the U.S.). The lakeshore of Lake Michigan is my favorite place, and my journey around the perimeter transformed the pinpoint experiences that I had with the lake at my favorite spots into a more holistic picture of the lake. 

I was astonished by the geology of the lake and how it varied depending on where you were along the shoreline. I had gravitated to the sandy beaches of western Michigan, but the northern shores of the lake are quite rocky with limestone outcroppings. Wisconsin's shoreline has huge red/grey clay bluffs for long stretches and much less sand (since it's on the leeward side of the lake). The southern shore of the lake is heavily industrialized in Indiana, and the southwest corner of the lake boasts the largest city in the Great Lakes basin: Chicago.

I came to several realizations about the lake:

1. Even though the waters of Lake Michigan are vast, they must be protected by all bordering governments in order for full protection to be conferred. Indiana gives a waiver for the BP oil refinery to dump sludge into the lake, and this effects the waters lapping at the other state's edges. A bigger vision must be attained to protect these waters.

2. After seeing large algae blooms and piles of zebra mussel shells and thickets of phragmites grass along the shoreline (among many other examples), I was surprised at how quickly invasive species can unbalance the ecosystem of the lake. It makes sense to me to either have strict ballast water laws (where no living thing is transported to our lakes) or to simply keep ocean-going vessels out of the basin and transfer their cargo to lake freighters that stay in the basin. With the lake levels at or approaching historic lows, the second option may be more feasible as larger vessels are unable to navigate the shallowing passages in the system.

3. The complex problems of Lake Michigan (and all of the Great Lakes) need a sophisticated approach to solve them. The U.S. has funded the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) at some level for several years. This program funds initiatives to measurably improve the health of the lakes in several areas: 

- Cleaning up toxics and areas of concern;
- Combating invasive species;
- Promoting nearshore health by protecting watersheds from polluted run-off;
- Restoring wetlands and other habitats; and
- Working with partners on outreach.

As I hiked, I saw areas where this initiative was making a difference. I believe this 5-year initiative incorporates the ""commons"" ideal and unifies stakeholders in the Great Lakes. 

The book about this first adventure is A 1000-MILE GREAT LAKES WALK. It was on the Heartland Indie Bestseller List in 2011 and won ""Best non-fiction Beach Read"" in 2012. I had over 70 appearances in my tour with this book. I gave readings at bookstores and also lectured about the lake at many venues (museums, schools, libraries, hiking clubs, Sierra Clubs, etc.).

My second hike was undertaken last year (2012). After getting to know Lake Michigan step-by-step, I started thinking about all of the Great Lakes and how these vast inland seas interact as a system. I decided to touch all of the lakes -- and many of the connecting waterways -- in my second 1000-mile hike. The book about this adventure is A 1000-MILE GREAT LAKES WALK. It will be available through select indie bookstores in April, then available wherever books are sold in June.

I have ~ 20 engagements already scheduled for this book tour and will add many more.

I have been amazed when I talk to people about the Great Lakes -- even people living in the Great Lakes Basin -- to find out that they don't know that these lakes are connected and are flowing to the North Atlantic. It seems many people think the waters are just ""here,"" not moving and flowing toward the ocean. 

My new book talks about the geology, hydrology, and ecology of the Great Lakes system, and I take the reader along with me on the shorelines of these vast inland seas. I raise important questions about preserving, protecting and revitalizing these waters. And I explain how important it is to get everyone to agree on guidelines and legislation on how we can use these waters without damaging them. 

I interviewed many scientists and experts doing research on the lakes (on everything from habitat restoration, to phytoplankton, to algae blooms, to control of the sea lamprey (and more). I have a background in the sciences (a masters in the biological sciences), so I read many of the published papers by these scientists in addition to interviewing them and distill that information in my books.

This Commons Map website states: ""The waters are a shared Commons and should be respected as a gift. The Great Lakes give us life, identity, and a shared duty to revitalize them. Rather than responding, a Commons ethic leads us toward a new vision based in relationships, belonging, and collaboration.""

I so agree with this unifying perspective on the Great Lakes. 

I think the U.S. GLRI legislation is in this ""commons"" spirit. And I think the understanding of how these inland seas flow and work together as a system will also foster a ""commons"" outlook.",2014-05-04T05:34:22.224478,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'MI', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Grand Traverse Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Traverse City', 'streetAddress': '215 E State St', 'postalCode': '49684', 'formattedAddress': '215 E State St, Traverse City, MI 49684'}, 'coords': [-85.620632, 44.763057]}",X-C77z3FSI-uAFsVa9LLNA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-04-13T19:00:00.000Z,36776-90,ushahidi,A 1000-MILE Great Lakes Walk book launch,"[{'name': 'Healing', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Stories & Places', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:29:25.548832,United States,MI,Grand Traverse Co.,Traverse City,"215 E State St, Traverse City, MI 49684",49684,215 E State St,"{'adminArea3': 'MI', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Grand Traverse Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Traverse City', 'streetAddress': '215 E State St', 'postalCode': '49684', 'formattedAddress': '215 E State St, Traverse City, MI 49684'}","[-85.620632, 44.763057]",44.763057,-85.620632,Healing,Stories & Places,,en

2014-05-09 19:30:01.362802,"1/3 acre initially 100% weed grass and 7/10 dying trees...changed to 5 % weed lawn and the rest heavily mulch new plantings. Intially 95% water run off to street changed with bioswale reforming through out to approx 90% retention. Still working on the immediate driveway for a roman drain into a mulch sump.We have the first city permitted retro install of a grey water stub out from the masterbath shower and tub water...Had to introduce the idea to the city for that one.

Here's how the project was completed:
1. We have a marvelous neighbor down the street that had a backhoe to break up the front yard brick planter facade when he was fiddling with his own property in 2007. I buried that rubble in our backyard bench when we built it in 2008.
2. The front yard  has about 10,000lb of river rock that I traded with my girlfriend when they were excavating their property. I was able to move or roll them into position in the front yard and dry stack raised elevations in the front. I used old cut concrete pieces to create stair steps with soil 'risers' in the center path.
3. I kept the original sprinkler system in the front but replaced the sprinkler heads with 2-3 foot risers to elevate the spray gently over the plants...I basically water for 1-2 hours every 3-4 weeks during the summer and the established plants are on their own in the winter...Since I eventually want to pasture chickens in the front yard...throwing away perfectly good irrigation and replacing it was a no go.
4. I worked with a garden fork on the front yard all 2007 winter and 2008 in 10x10 ft patches to sift and remove the Bermuda and Kikuyu grasses. I have very sandy soils with roots that come out easily but because I DON'T spray anything other than water, it was therapy and genuflection for some time to confirm eradication of those beasts. 
5. We had a Bobcat front loader change all the elevations in the back yard. Initially we had one flat direct direction all draining into our patio, flooding with each rain about 4-6 inches. We dropped the soil line about 16 inches several yards from the back patio, keeping all soil on site in a mound braced by the 'ear' shaped retaining wall and bench in the middle of the yard.... a very large Bioswale.
6. Then came the start of the 5,000 gallon collection of coffee grounds from Starbucks over 21 months. Each week, I sheet mutched sections after weed removal with the new next door neighbor's moving boxes and coffee grounds....Did I tell you that I chase tree chipping trucks?...about 50 cubic yards in all with the several loads over 3 yrs. I pay them to dump and spread but only the good stuff ( making friends with them first and a 6pack for later doesn't hurt).
7. Most of the roof run off is captured with a DIY gutter system, tanking with IBC (275gal) tote tanks in the critical area and drained in the back. I still want to place a roman drain in the lower end of the driveway...that project is creeping up on the lists but not until I find that old 12x12x4 wall brick with voids in it (I have an overwhelming need to scrounge materials in small incremental pieces).
8. My goals are to have all perennials, to eventually stub out the daughter's shower, get the 5,000gal rain storage tank in place, and have that driveway drain in....then the property can be an example for what we should be doing with original construction.",2014-05-04T05:41:35.440873,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'CA', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Ventura Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Camarillo', 'streetAddress': '2401 Ventura Blvd', 'postalCode': '93010', 'formattedAddress': '2401 Ventura Blvd, Camarillo, CA 93010'}, 'coords': [-119.037602, 34.216394]}",I7reAV6URw6J5W-sJqJgeQ,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-04-13T01:06:00.000Z,12605-128,ushahidi,"Appletree Court - Camarillo, CA","[{'name': 'Retention - Downspout Re-direct', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Permeability - Healthy Living Soil', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Retention - Sponge Gardens', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Retention - Retention Devices', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Conservation - Irrigation', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Conservation - Mulch', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Conservation - Plants', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Conservation - Water Features', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:30:01.362802,United States,CA,Ventura Co.,Camarillo,"2401 Ventura Blvd, Camarillo, CA 93010",93010,2401 Ventura Blvd,"{'adminArea3': 'CA', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Ventura Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Camarillo', 'streetAddress': '2401 Ventura Blvd', 'postalCode': '93010', 'formattedAddress': '2401 Ventura Blvd, Camarillo, CA 93010'}","[-119.037602, 34.216394]",34.216394,-119.037602,Retention - Downspout Re-direct,Permeability - Healthy Living Soil,Retention - Sponge Gardens,en

2014-05-09 19:28:30.180363,"In an article published in the Toronto Star on April 6, 2013, a surgeon at Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan said two women told her that Syrian Army soldiers had raped them but later recanted their stories.

The surgeon, Dr. Hala al Ghawi, said one of the women told her that she was gang-raped by soldiers who broke into her home while her husband was demonstrating in Homs. “She was very emotional and crying to me,” al Ghawi said. 

However, the next day, al Ghawi said, the woman said she had not been raped. “She was scared if her husband or brothers found out her husband would divorce her and her brothers would kill her after the divorce,” al Ghawi said.

Al Ghawi’s husband, Dr. Mohamed Abo Hilal, also treats Syrian refugees who have faced severe trauma. After being detained and tortured by Syrian authorities last year, he said, he fled from Damascus to Amman, where he now runs two clinics with a team of counselors. Though many of his 200 patients have said their neighbors or friends have experienced sexualized violence, he said, none have admitted to personal experiences of rape. 

“We think that the regime, when the arrest women and put them in jail, the rapes happen in jail,” he said. He believes that sexual assaults occur most frequently in areas like Homs that are home to a number of religious sects. There, it is “easy for opposition groups or the regime to demonize the other size.” He said that while there there can be no certainty due to the lack of real documentation, he believes that rape is not “systematic like in Bosnia.” 

The dates and locations of the reported rapes are unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:24:13.461293,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea1': 'Syria', 'formattedAddress': 'Syria'}, 'coords': [38.996815, 34.802075]}",V-4xOJGbS6ecNWhMBoL0ow,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-04-06T05:10:00.000Z,34369-183,ushahidi,Surgeon at Zaatari refugee camp says survivor of rape feared honor killing,"[{'name': '3GF.

The Duluth News Tribune reports, “Officials at Calumet LLC, owners of the Superior oil refinery, are considering building a $25 million crude oil transfer dock in Superior, where oil would be loaded onto tankers and barges and moved across the Great Lakes to refineries in Ontario, Michigan, Ohio and even the East Coast.”

Superior, Wisconsin is located on the western tip of Lake Superior, adjacent to Duluth, Minnesota (the two cities together form a single metropolitan area called the Twin Ports).

“Oil purchased by Calumet would run from Alberta and North Dakota to Superior over existing Enbridge Energy pipelines. Calumet would then move the oil into its own short pipeline system from the refinery area to a new waterfront facility at the former Georgia Pacific Plant. …It’s estimated that, because of the small size of the supply pipeline, the terminal could fill a single tanker or barge about once every three or four days. ….The typical tanker is just over 400 feet long and can hold about 77,000 barrels… A typical barge is about the same length and can hold up to 118,000 barrels.”

“Despite concerns about potential environmental catastrophe, Calumet seems well on its way to moving oil out of the Twin Ports by boat. Calumet will seek permits and do preliminary work this year and would conduct dredging, dock, pipeline and storage construction in 2014 and be ready to ship oil by March 2015.”

Council of Canadians chairperson Maude Barlow has written, “There are currently 17 major refinery projects either being planned or developed around the Lakes. The biggest is the BP refinery in Whiting on the south-eastern shore of Lake Michigan in Indiana, which is in the midst of a controversial expansion project aimed at boosting its capacity to process bitumen from the Canadian tar sands. Already, the plant’s unpermitted modifications have resulted in a significant increase in nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and particulate matter. An expansion of the Murphy Oil plant in Superior, Wisconsin could damage 300 to 500 acres of wetlands and consume 5 million gallons (almost 20 million litres) of water from Lake Michigan every day.”

Time is of the essence to stop the proposal.</p>
<p><em>Visit our website to learn more &amp; sign the petition.  A sample from the website: </em></p>
<p>""Reasons To Be Concerned""</p>
<p>1. Radioactive Waste Beside Lake Huron? Any risk of radioactive nuclear waste contaminating the Great Lakes is too great a risk to take and need not be taken.</p>
<p>2. Buried Radioactive Waste is Forever Toxic - Some intermediate level radioactive nuclear waste remains toxic for 100,000 years.</p>
<p>3. This Rock is Right? No scientist or geologist can provide us with a 100,000 year guarantee.</p>
<p>4. OPG Faith In Computer Modelling Computer - models cannot predict what will happen in 100,000 years; the models cannot be validated or verified.</p>
<p>5. International Impacts Ignored - Burying radioactive nuclear waste beside the Great Lakes could impact 40 million people.</p>
<p>6. Highly Controversial Dump Site Selection - There was no process to look at any other locations for the low and intermediate level Nuclear Waste Dump in Canada.</p>
<p>7. 2nd Dump Planned - The Kincardine Nuclear Waste Dump will pave the way for a high level Nuclear Waste Dump to store highly toxic radioactive spent nuclear fuel.</p>

Pulled from their car at a checkpoint, Nawar said that she and her fiancé, a doctor named Ahmed, were tortured in front of each other.

“They put us facing each other,” she said. “When they questioned him, they hit me. When they questioned me, they would hit him. They removed my clothes in front of him. Then they removed his clothes….”

Nawar went on to say: “They pissed on me. They pulled out seven of my teeth. Then for one week there was nothing, and then they released me. I didn’t find out they had already killed Ahmed until some weeks later.”

Nawar told Global Post that she has met with nearly 100 female refugees in Jordon, Lebanon, and Turkey who have also been victims of violence or sexual assault.

“No one else will speak out, so I will speak for all of them,” she said.

A system based on 3 key elements:

LuxNode:
The Plug and Play nodes are mounted directly into the lamps. The configuration is automatic, each node looking for the closest available one. The nodes both transmit and receive messages from the system gateway «LuxGate», and from each other. They control light turn on/off, dimming, as well as alarms and sensors. In case of outage, each node acts autonomously and ensures operational continuity of the system.


LuxGate:
The gateway between the LuxNodes and LuxSoftware. LuxGate is installed near a power source and Internet connection (Wifi, Ethernet or GPRS). The gateway enables data communication from LuxSoftware to the nodes. The information retrieved from the nodes by LuxGate can be displayed on any computer connected to the Internet which has LuxSoftware installed.

2014-05-09 19:28:31.945100,"A video posted to YouTube on March 31 shows men cutting the hair off a man and then a woman. 

It begins with an officer holding a pair of metal scissors cutting another man’s hair off, all the while insulting him and accusing him of being a rebel. The man does not struggle, but repeatedly denies being a rebel. The sound isn’t very clear, but the man seems to repeat, “I swear it wasn’t me, I swear it wasn’t me.” 

In the background there is a woman pleading with another officer, and her voice becomes clearer as she explains that she was “just at the checkpoint.” The woman is then brought in front of the camera and is told to take off her headscarf. 

The woman repeatedly calls the officer holding the scissors ""Abu Salim,"" but an activist told WMC’s Women Under Siege that the man’s real name is Jamal Suleiman and that he is a shabiha (plainclothes militia) member in Idlib. The woman pleads with him and tries to give them her story, but the men accuse her of her being a liar. They argue over whether she was in touch with certain people or not as Abu Salim shaves her head and says that someone has already “confessed” about her. 

“I swear I didn’t, I swear I’m not going out,“ she says, implying that she is not in touch with the people they are accusing her of contacting. 

Abu Salim laughs at her statement and says, “You’re not going out? You never even sit down! “ 

Abu Salim cut her hair to the scalp, and when she asks for a minute and reaches to wipe away a tear he slaps her head back down. 

The officers around Abu Salim mumble accusations, most of the sound isn’t clear but one of them says loudly, ‘’Leader of a brigade! “ in reference to someone the woman was allegedly in contact with. 

All of the officers start screaming accusations about “tanks” and “armored vehicles” at her simultaneously, and the woman repeats that she swears she doesn’t know what they’re talking about.

WASH improvements can be as straightforward as the design and availability of improved latrines that do not contaminate ground water and prevent the breeding of germ-carrying insects. 

In Sierra Leone, only 31% of the entire nation have access to improved sanitation, the majority are people living in urban areas.

Every year, food and water tainted with fecal matter cause 2.5 billion cases of diarrhea among children under five, resulting in 1.5 million child deaths.  Chronic illness hinders child development by impeding the uptake of essential nutrients that are critical to the health of children’s minds, bodies and immune systems.

This is an in-progress compilation of materials for the Great Lakes and how their overall decline and dramatic drop in water levels is symptomatic of the clear, present, accelerating threat & planetary EMERGENCY posed by the climate crisis RIGHT NOW to:

- global freshwater supply
- food / agriculture production
- the security / stability of nations
- the survival of civilization as we now know it

See the EcoSanity link below for the complete report of climate connections. 

My view [EcoSanity] is that while there are many local problems, the biggest threat to the lakes is global -- climate disruption induced evaporation, which will continue for a long time.  For this reason, I think the content of my compilation is pretty much what I have to say about it.  
 
For me [EcoSanity], the commons question is intimidating. Maybe because the expectation is to speak more personally. I care about the health of the great lakes because I've lived on lake Ontario's shoreline all my life and I see and dread how they are treated every day. I know they sustain us and I'm sad and scared that they are being degraded and disappearing. I consider them precious and the current situation is a crime and an affront to the most basic of rights for all life.",2014-05-04T05:34:23.385229,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Toronto', 'adminArea5': 'Toronto', 'postalCode': 'M5G', 'formattedAddress': 'Toronto, ON M5G, Canada'}, 'coords': [-79.383184, 43.653226]}",0xccAvHJRNWHYErLtNZMEA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-03-24T13:44:00.000Z,36776-94,ushahidi,Great Lakes and Climate Change Connections,"[{'name': 'Harming (General)', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:29:25.913650,Canada,ON,Toronto,Toronto,"Toronto, ON M5G, Canada",M5G,,"{'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Toronto', 'adminArea5': 'Toronto', 'postalCode': 'M5G', 'formattedAddress': 'Toronto, ON M5G, Canada'}","[-79.383184, 43.653226]",43.653226,-79.383184,Harming (General),,,en

2014-05-09 19:28:40.932392,"Being in the category of Niger-Delta States, but not having marginal oil fields in its geography, the Government of Cross River State has from inception been focussed on building a non-oil local economy. This strategy is pivoted on establishing environmental fundamentals for the build-up of self-sustaining zones in specific industrial sectors such as Tourism, Energy Services, Health, Entertainment and ICT, each as a special component of an integrated economic zone where regulations, skills, infrastructure, and governance are all geared towards facilitating a targeted economic development. 
The Tinapa Knowledge City (TKC) project, an initiative of the Cross River State Government (CRSG)with support from the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), will evolve into the establishment of a digital knowledge hub in the West and Central African sub region. It follows similar concepts that have been implemented and are operational in various parts of the developed and developing world. The project aims to provide world-class operational facilities, infrastructure, and services for the development of a viable industrial cluster that will attract mature technology businesses from Nigeria and abroad. It will also promote maturing businesses by offering globally competitive support services they require to attain long-term stability and profitability. Overall, the TKC when fully realised in partnership with complementary organizations such as universities, research institutions and incubators will encourage the formation and growth of knowledge-based businesses in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector and other sectors. It will actively support information and communication technology brokering and enhance the business prospects of tenant firms. TKC will facilitate knowledge and technology transfer to the broader local economy thereby acting as a catalyst for job and wealth creation.

TKC is located in a 10,000sqm facility in the famous Tinapa Business Resort which provides  world-class infrastructure required to set up the Technology and Business Park. These include: modern office complexes, 24x7 electricity supply, security, broadband internet (STM-1) etc.  in “green” layout, proximity to Calabar International Airport; strategically located in the most active Free Trade Zone on the West/Central African axes . 
Opening in April 2013 with a Software Incubator, followed in October 2013 by a full launch of a bouquet of fully-equipped services, TKC will provide a launch pad for unleashing innovation and diversifying the economic potentials of the state, national and regional economy.",2014-05-04T05:26:04.903168,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'Cross River', 'adminArea1': 'Nigeria', 'adminArea4': 'Calabar Municipal', 'formattedAddress': 'Calabar Municipal, Nigeria', 'adminArea5': 'Calabar'}, 'coords': [8.325, 4.95]}",EMYSPLjpTbeZsn1sYZdy1A,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-03-24T11:57:00.000Z,32383-110,ushahidi,"Tinapa Knowledge City, Odiabo-Calabar Nigeria","[{'name': 'Technology Hubs', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Business Incubators', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'HackerSpaces', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:28:40.932392,Nigeria,Cross River,Calabar Municipal,Calabar,"Calabar Municipal, Nigeria",,,"{'adminArea3': 'Cross River', 'adminArea1': 'Nigeria', 'adminArea4': 'Calabar Municipal', 'formattedAddress': 'Calabar Municipal, Nigeria', 'adminArea5': 'Calabar'}","[8.325, 4.95]",4.95,8.325,Technology Hubs,Business Incubators,HackerSpaces,en

2014-05-09 19:30:18.992874,"From CLB:

Management at the Nanhai Honda automotive plant, scene of a groundbreaking strike in the summer of 2010, has agreed to a better pay deal for junior workers after around 100 production line workers went out on strike on 18 March.

The workers were unhappy with a pay deal announced by management and the enterprise trade union that would have given them just a 10.2 percent increase, about 160 to 220 yuan per month, while senior employees got a 19.8 percent increase.

The workers reported on their weibo today that under the new deal, agreed on the afternoon of 19 March, junior workers would get a salary increase of 14.4 percent, or 310 yuan per month, plus a housing subsidy of 50 yuan.

However, some of the workers are worried about the repercussions of their strike action, saying that it reflected badly on the company’s reputation.

After the workers went out on strike, one female employee said:

A manager came to persuade us, saying that previously our wages were indeed low, so it was normal for us to stage a strike back then. However, you cannot always resort to strike action to solve our problems. Look around, our salary is already higher than the neighboring factories.

There are concerns that some of the strike leaders may be disciplined or fired after reportedly being criticized by management and enterprise union officials who negotiated the pay deal. It is quite common for labour activists at China’s factories to suffer reprisals, if not immediately after a strike action, then a few months later when labour relations are calmer.",2014-05-04T05:44:55.499134,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'Guangdong', 'adminArea1': 'China', 'formattedAddress': 'Guangdong'}, 'coords': [113.143313, 23.028904]}",64IpzpYBSSi3Mc8PYtI6tQ,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-03-18T16:37:00.000Z,9845-600,ushahidi,"Honda Workers Strike in Nanhai, Guangdong","[{'name': 'Payment / Change of Co.

Many questions follow this current situation. But let's start with a clip from the news link:

""Detroit — Newly minted emergency manager Kevyn Orr signaled Friday he is open to finding ways to generate cash from the city's assets like the water system, and may revisit plans to run Belle Isle as a state park.

Orr said he might consider turning over management of the city's Water and Sewerage Department to a regional authority to leverage lease payments and shed billions of dollars in debt from the city's ledger.

If Detroit can convert the water system into a ""net income generating machine"" while maintaining ownership, he said, the idea should be considered — even if it sparks outcry from city residents who believe Gov. Rick Snyder's emergency manager will strip Detroit of its assets.""

Questions for you:

How many months/years is your Great Lakes municipality away from such an enclosure?

How are citizens organizing and educating for change?

Is selling/renting off City assets part of the solution or part of the problem? 

If public water services are part of a water commons - can they really be managed by anyone who's not representing the public's interest?

2014-05-09 19:28:30.800409,"Turkish news channel Haber 7 TV aired a segment in which a Turkish-speaking Syrian women describes countless atrocities allegedly committed in various cities by the Assad regime, including indiscriminate rape and killing of noncombatants and sexualized torture in detention. 

Throughout much of the 12-minute feature, the witness speaks over video footage that shows bombings, beatings, and wounded civilians in unspecified locations. Her face and eyes remain fully covered to protect her identity, and although she makes clear that her own family is among those who have suffered she does not specify how. 

“I do not want to tell what my family has been through,” she says. “But you can find my family’s story inside the stories I have told you. One of them is our story. Some people in my family were killed, tortured, wounded.” 

The woman says in addition to the warplanes, tanks and guns being used in the conflict, the regime has  “invented the most horrible torture techniques,” the “first and most important” of which is rape. Women are raped, she says, in “all sorts of ways.”

“They raped women in front of their fathers, mothers, sons, daughters. Even the women whose fingernails were not even seen by any man in their lives. The regime’s gangs raped them.”

She continues, “They kidnapped women from streets, and most of them were college students. They killed these women while raping them. They threw them on the street naked.” In Qudsaya, a town 4 miles (7 kilometers) west of Damascus in the Rif Dimashq governorate, she says that women were dragged through the neighborhood by their tied feet. “They enter houses, rape, and kill,” she says. “They only leave one person alive so this person can tell the other people what had happened to them… . Once, they shot a woman, and while she was dying they raped her.” 

By her account, the rapes and murders are wholesale and unchecked: “They do not let children live, do not let old people live, do not let women live. All are raped and cut.” 

Next she describes the various methods of torture inflicted upon detainees, some of which she implies she may have witnessed, referring to “many videos in my cell.” She does not specify whether the crimes allegedly occurred in an official or unofficial detention center, or whether the perpetrators were government forces or shabiha (plainclothes militia) members. 

She recounts how they dragged a man, wearing only his underwear, from his house. When he begged to see his children one last time, they replied, “Yes, you can see your children, but then we have to rape your wife.” As he protested, she says, they “lowered his underwear, and one of them was trying to rape him and the other one was saying, ‘Let’s cut his dick.’” 

The woman describes how jailers give men electric shocks to their penises “so they cannot have children in the future” as well as other types of torture.

The dates and locations of the reported rapes and sexualized torture is unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:24:17.993028,,"{'addressComponents': {'streetAddress': 'Highway', 'adminArea1': 'Syria', 'formattedAddress': 'Highway, Syria'}, 'coords': [36.198111, 33.536816]}",qpxD9ACwRCyHukgfYfwiVA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-03-17T08:47:00.000Z,34369-180,ushahidi,Woman tells Turkish news channel of widespread rape and sexualized torture in Syria,"[{'name': '2GF.

2014-05-09 19:29:29.121109,"On the invitation by the Aamjiwnaang First Nation, I traveled to Sarnia to see where oil, gasoline, and plastics come from.

The photos here only capture part of the experience, but a few notes on the day.

About 100 of us walked over 10 kilometers and by several petrochemical plants that keep Sarnia and our fossil fuel economy going. We started in Rainbow park and ended at the Aamjiwnaang Community Centre.

We made several pauses along the way to honour our solidarity with each other, our right to clean air, water, and earth, our anger with the corporate powers that value profit over people, and our commitment to remember those who have died and our love of life. 

What struck me most were two things.

The scale of the land occupied by this petrochemical tenant is staggering. We walked all afternoon and only got a snapshot of this industrial giant. Stranded in the middle of this monster was Aamjiwnaang First Nation. Fueling our economy is an industry emptying the richness and desires of all peoples, but especially First Nations from coast to coast to coast. 

Then there is the St. Clair river. While flowing by our side for most of the walk, there is no mutuality between industry and nature. For industry, the river is a sink, a tanker lane, and a barrier to bury pipelines underneath. As I watched the river's strong current moving south, all I could really feel was anxiety - wondering how many days until this very water was flowing in my home shores of Lake Ontario.

2014-05-09 19:30:00.405182,"Designer - Pamela Berstler with G3/The Green Gardens Group. Design and planting changes were made by the City of Santa Barbara Parks Department.
Installation - community Garden Assistance Parties (GAP), led by G3, and sponsored by a Whale Tail License Plate Grant from the California Coastal Commission.

The turf grass in front of the Park's building was not well-used, used lots of (drinking) water, generated polluted runoff, and required regular maintenance by City Parks Department staff. Here are the steps taken to prep the site and install the garden:

1. A Hands-On Workshop on Site Evaluation - to evaluate existing conditions and come up with design ideas;

2. Sheet mulching the turfgrass - the turfgrass was removed by the Park's Dept.; The first of two GAPs focused on contouring the site to absorb rainwater as well as sheet mulching, using G3's sheet mulching guide (re-building healthy soil, then layering paper and mulch). All soil was retained on site and bermed, enabling the planting of local native plants into soil that was free-draining;

3. Installing the beautiful dry streambed and redirecting the raingutter downspout into it - both done by the Parks Dept. Rainwater will be the primary source of irrigation. See the photo of the streambed filled with water right after a rainstorm!

4. Install plants and drip irrigation - done through a second GAP. The irrigation sprayheads were either converted to drip irrigation (or capped), and helps get the plants established. We realized an 80% reduction in water use and eliminating dry-weather runoff. Native or just climate appropriate plants were used (some came from the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden). We followed G3's planting guide to ensure plants and soil were well saturated. Irrigation equipment was donated by All Around Irrigation (www.allaroundirrigation.com)

As a bonus, the project qualified for a nice rebate under LADWP’s Turf Removal Program.”

After digging up their front lawn, sketching out a site plan, and securing plants and materials -- all with guidance from Surfrider -- Laura and her family invited friends, family, and community members to participate in a Garden Assistance Party at their home, led by landscape professionals with Surfrider's West LA-Malibu Chapter. In less than six hours, participants transformed the site. They learned how to create berms and swales for visual interest and rainwater retention, planted more than 50 climate-friendly plants, and applied compost tea and mulch to build soil health, reduce watering needs, and retard weeds.

“It’s astonishing how quickly the space was converted from blah to beautiful,” said Laura. “Now we look forward to stepping out our front door each morning. And the bees are happy too!

Since then I have been working with the charities: Buddhist Education for Peace and Nonviolence Center (BEPNC), Member for World Peace (MWP) and have worked as a teacher for Building the Future for Generations of Cambodia (BFGC). I am committed to helping the poor and improving the lives of children in Cambodia so they may reach their fullest potential.

RSP is a charity committed to helping children of the poorest families in Cambodia. Cambodia is ranked as one of the 20 least developed countries in our world. As such, those who live at the fringes of Cambodian society live a life of desperate poverty with few opportunities to escape from this poverty or improve their lives. These people typically have little food, no education and few skills, leaving them unable to improve their lives or the lives of their children.

2014-05-09 19:28:30.894265,"A video produced by the Syrian Free Press Network summarizes the rapes and killings allegedly committed by a member of what it calls a “terrorist group” in Baba Amr, Homs. A media-sharing platform called Before It’s News, which allows registered users to post current events and commentary, added the video on February 28. The Syrian Free Press Network refers to itself as a collection of freelance reporters “for the truth, for Syria; for evidence of conspiracy against Syria,” A page linked to their website clarifies their stance as staunchly pro-regime.

The segment of the news clip that addresses the alleged attacks begins approximately eight minutes in, with a statement by the newscaster that “terrorist Hassam Ali Bakkour confessed to taking part in acts of abduction, rape, and slaughter along with a terrorist group in Homs, in addition to joining Al-Qaeda in Iraq.” 

The newscaster notes that the featured confession first aired on “Syrian TV,” meaning the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA). SANA is a privately owned but “semi-official” source known for its loyalty to the regime. Footage of this original clip is shown without sound, and the Syrian Free Press Network’s recap is in English: 

“…Bakkour said that he entered Iraq illegally and joined a group of 200 gunmen from Al-Qaeda in Baghdad, where they participated in terrorist operations for nine days before being told that their work was over and they should return to Syria. He said that he was instructed to abduct four young women from Baba Amr, so he went to where they lived along with four other gunmen, abducted them, and took them to a basement near the roundabout in Baba Amr where they blindfolded them and left them there, only to return the next day and rape them and, later, kill them. He said that afterward, they abducted 10 citizens from various areas in Homs and took them to the same basement and slit their throats in a similar manner.”

The date of the alleged rapes is unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:24:15.723695,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea1': 'Syria', 'formattedAddress': 'Syria'}, 'coords': [36.687632, 34.709052]}",WWa0aaDRTX2t7H6Q8b1Jpg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-02-28T19:22:00.000Z,34369-171,ushahidi,Pro-regime news source alleges Al-Qaeda in Iraq member raped women in Baba Amr,"[{'name': '3NGF.

2014-05-09 19:28:30.692327,"A segment on the Egypt-based TV channel Souria Alghad, or Syria Tomorrow, addresses both the circumstances surrounding the many cases of rape and sexualized violence in Syria as well as the stigma faced by victims in need of medical care and psychosocial services. The clip, which was posted to YouTube by a Nora News account on February 9, features interviews by a man named Yassin Ali with Syrian human rights activists and a number of other professionals in the field. The channel, which describes itself as ""independent"" on its Facebook page, says it aims ""to be a free voice for all Syrians of all affiliations, and to be a truthful image for every inch of Syrian territory."" 

Samah Al-Hadi, an activist and journalist, is the first to speak, her face obscured by dim lighting to protect her identity. “Nobody can follow up on this issue,” she says, referring to the difficulties faced by those seeking to document rape. 

“I heard about a young girl, 13 or 14 years old, who got raped in Reef Damascus [the countryside]. I tried to reach her, to understand the truth and how it happened. I heard she was with her parents and they were stopped at a roadblock by the regime forces. Something provoked the father and he spoke rudely to them. As revenge, they took the girl out of the car and went out of sight for a while. When they came back she was crying. 

“I had difficulty finding the family. When her relatives and acquaintances found out I was a journalist and that I document similar cases, they worked hard to prevent me from meeting her so that I would not shame her. When I was able to reach the mother and introduce myself, she told the father who I was. He immediately kicked me out of the house. He was in a very difficult mental state. He kept telling me, ‘No girl here was raped,’ and then he wept. That is how much emotional stress he was under. He is a wounded father. I respected his wish and left.” 

A writer named Nawal Al-Sibai says she faced similar struggles when she reported from the city where the revolution began. “It was handled wrong from the beginning, when children in Daraa were raped. I was the only one who dared, after three months, to write about the mutilation and cutting off of the genitalia of one child.” 

Many of the women discussed the pervasiveness of regime-perpetrated sexualized violence in Syria. Al-Sibai says: “The rape of women is like the rape of men: both are crimes.” Both of these crimes have been “taking place in the Ba’ath regimes in Syria and Iraq, in a systematic way, for the last 50 years.” 

When asked if rapes were occurring during home raids, Al-Hadi says the groups that make up the regime’s forces are not all the same. “Homes are being raided and searched,” she says. “Nobody can predict what other things can happen too.” 

“Syria is a big prison,” she says. Some of the government forces “are prepared psychologically, trained and sometimes chosen from a specific sect, to carry out these atrocities. The same thing for slaughtering with knives, executing unarmed civilians, killing little children, or crushing skulls with a machete or an axe.” 

She tells the story of Rasha Alabd, an emergency technician in Duma, who she says was caring for the wounded in a house. Every inhabitant, including Alabd’s family, she says, was killed. She describes seeing Alabd’s head crushed in with what she believes were axes belonging to government forces.

Sabah says she also knows of a 50-year-old woman who was groped and patted down when men raided her home. 

Human rights activist Jud Attar relates another story: “A young activist from the Alawite sect was approached by a very close male friend who claimed he wanted to defect. She believed him and accompanied him to a civilian office where he threatened to turn her in if she resisted his sexual advances. He said, ‘Would you rather go to prison where you will be tortured, raped repeatedly and maybe even killed?’” The woman says that in this instance, the “psychological and emotional trauma was huge,"" but does not specify if and how she was sexually assaulted.

The program stresses that the suffering of the survivors is compounded by the traditional belief system that prizes purity. Abdullah Almoussi, a member of the Syrian Student Association, cites the rarity with which a victim of rape, or her family, will report the incident. In most cases the reason they don’t report is the “dominant culture that dwells on protecting the girls’ and the families’ reputations.” 

Al-Sibai argues that victim-shaming is in part caused by a societal conflation of rape and adultery, and that we must distinguish between the two. “Rape is a crime committed by an individual with power, towards a weaker victim who is refusing to submit, in order to break the victim’s will and humiliate her,” she says. “Adultery is a sin between an individual and his Lord and creator.”

She goes on to say: “Those women did not choose to have this happen. They protected their honor. They are princesses of purity. Real honor is in your actions, according to Messenger Muhammad. There is no honor killing in Islam, and whoever commits that is a criminal himself.” 

A Syrian doctor who asked to remain anonymous explains that she is using experiences gained from the Bosnian war, in which an estimated 50,000-60,000 women were raped, to treat survivors of rape. “We help with shelter so the victim can feel human again,” she says, “and we let her speak on her own without pressuring her. She needs to feel secure.” 

A voiceover describes how victims of sexualized violence are tormented by the silence within Syrian society and at the international level. 

In her final words, Al-Sibai says: “Honor does not go away if the body is attacked and insulted forcefully. The real honor is the ability of the society to wake up and protect its men and women from such crimes.” 

The remainder of the clip contains part of a video WMC’s Women Under Siege has previously posted to this map. It features a former prisoner of the regime who attests to the rape of a 16-year-old girl being held in the same prison, and ends with a slogan of defiance written across the screen: “The Syrian women will remain the icon of the revolution that gave the father martyrdom, the brother martyrdom and the son martyrdom.” 

The dates and exact locations of the reported acts of sexualized violence are unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:24:25.223766,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea1': 'Syria', 'formattedAddress': 'Damascus, Syria', 'adminArea5': 'Damascus'}, 'coords': [36.3064, 33.5111]}",KyHxxR2xTkOnHguC7X5eeA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-02-13T08:53:00.000Z,34369-153,ushahidi,Activists describe sexualized violence and it consequences in Souria Alghad TV segment,"[{'name': '1GF.

The task force said the women had taken cover in a shelter while the men fled to avoid capture during a raid. They were held there for two days and repeatedly gang-raped, the task force said.

Task force members said they know a few of the women in this case and that one, an 18- or 19-year-old, was forced to marry her cousin as a result. Her husband told the task force that “nothing happened to her,” but a psychologist who had treated the woman said that she was raped in the incident. When the task force met the woman in April in Jordan, she was in obvious distress: “She was only crying,” they said.

The exact dates of the alleged rapes are unknown.

2014-05-09 19:28:31.331535,"An activist using the pseudonym Rami al-Jundi told WMC’s Women Under Siege a story relayed to him by a cellmate while the two were detained at the Latakia political branch in March.

The cellmate said he’d been previously held at the Latakia Sports City, a massive complex we’ve written about here: https://womenundersiegesyria.crowdmap.com/reports/view/219. While at the complex, he said, he learned about a married woman who had been arrested with her 4-year-old son from a checkpoint at the entrance to the city sometime in February; the two had been seeking refugee from fighting in Aleppo, where they were from.

The cellmate told Al-Jundi that this woman was raped anally every day for more than three months—from before he arrived at the complex until he left in March.

Al-Jundi said that he has heard that anal rape is the norm at the sports complex, where, he estimates, about 950 women are being held. He said he and his colleagues had arrived at this number using their own observations from having been inside and then comparing those with the numbers of people missing.

Various activists allege that the center is run by Hilal al-Assad, a cousin of Bashar al-Assad.

<span></span>I have been reviewing some of the early returns from North American museums to Italy. One that featured in the <i>Nostoi</i> exhibition (no. 39) was a Greek text on lead sheets now displayed in the Museo Civico in Castelvetrano in Sicily. The text is a <i>lex sacra </i>linked to cults at the Greek colony of Selinus in south-western Sicily.<br />
<br />
The lead sheet was acquired by the J. Paul Getty Museum in 1981, deaccessioned in 1991, and returned to Italy in 1992. Shortly afterwards the text was published by M.H. Jameson, D.R. Jordan and R.D. Kotansky in <i>A Lex Sacra from Selinous</i> (Greek, Roman and Byzantine monographs 11; Duke University, 1993). John Walsh explained that as ""the Getty Museum does not exhibit material of primarily historical interest, we concluded that the piece would be better returned to Italy"". Walsh also affirmed the ""importance"" of the inscription ""for further study and interpretation of the site of ancient Selinous"".<br />
<br />
Jason Felch and Ralph Frammolino mention the return (<i>Chasing Aphrodite</i>, 118-19):<br />
<blockquote>
The Lex Sacra ... was inscribed with instructions for a religious ritual and had been traced to a sanctuary of Demeter near ... Selinunte. Despite the tablet's historical significance, the Getty had never taken it out of storage because it was not deemed beautiful enough for public display. Now, without any prompting, the cirator was willing to give it back.</blockquote>
They place the return in the wake of the October 1991 Rome conference where recently surfaced antiquities were discussed.<br />

</tbody></table>
This is not the only inscription on a lead plaque linked to Selinus and acquired by the Getty. ""<a href=""http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/deciphering-the-getty-hexameters/"">The Getty Hexameters</a>"" tablet was also acquired in 1981 as a gift from Dr Max Gerchik (inv. <a href=""http://search.getty.edu/museum/records/musobject?objectid=18820"">81.AI.140.2</a>). (The inscription was first loaned in 1980.) The Getty catalogue suggests that it was derived from Selinus. This is one of several lead plaques acquired from Gerchik in 1981 with a Selinus link.<br />
<br />
It is of more than passing interest that Max Gerchik was the donor of an Attic red-figured bell-krater that has also been returned to Italy (inv. 81.AE.149; Gill and Chippindale, no. 15; Nostoi no. 30).<br />
<br />
Will the Getty be releasing full details of the collecting histories of these and other Sicilian pieces acquired by the museum? Where did Gerchik acquire them? How long did they reside in his ""collection""? What is the basis of the Sicilian association?<br />

2014-05-09 19:08:45.248122,"<span></span>I have been re-reading Anna Maria Bietti Sestieri's <i>The Iron Age Community of Osteria Dell'Osa: A Study of Socio-Political Development in Central Tyrrhenian Italy</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992). My interest was to get some additional information about the Villanovan bronze hut-urn in the Villa Giulia that was found in the Osteria cemetery at Vulci. Sestieri reminds us that the nature of the finds has prompted ""clandestine digging and looting of graves"" (p. 9).<br />
<br />
The Osteria bronze hut-urn is also discussed in Francesco Buranelli's ""The bronze hut urn in the Metropolitan Museum of Art"", <i>MMJ</i> 21 (1986) 5-12 [<a href=""http://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/journals/1/pdf/1512821.pdf.bannered.pdf"">MMA website</a>]. Interestingly Buranelli points to a third example that surfaced in Palladion Antike Kunst in Basel with a significant Vulci association.<br />
<br />
So what is the background to the <a href=""http://lootingmatters.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/villanovan-bronze-hut-from-undisclosed.html"">Princeton bronze hut-urn</a>? Where was it found? Who handled it? Who sold it?<br />

There are many more in these struggles then I have painted,  a portrait speaks for a thousand others.

2014-05-09 19:30:20.186926,"From The Huffington Post:

Hundreds of Chinese factory workers angry about strictly timed bathroom breaks and fines for starting work late held their Japanese and Chinese managers hostage for a day and a half before police broke up the strike.

About 1,000 workers at Shanghai Shinmei Electric Company held the 10 Japanese nationals and eight Chinese managers inside the factory in Shanghai starting Friday morning until 11.50 p.m. Saturday, said a statement from the parent company, Shinmei Electric Co., released Monday. It said the managers were released uninjured after 300 police officers were called to the factory.

A security guard at the Shanghai plant said Tuesday that workers had gone on strike to protest the company's issuing of new work rules, including time limits on bathroom breaks and fines for being late.

""The workers demanded the scrapping of the ridiculously strict requirements stipulating that workers only have two minutes to go to the toilet and workers will be fined 50 yuan ($8) if they are late once and fired if they are late twice,"" said the security guard, surnamed Feng. ""The managers were later freed when police intervened and when they agreed to reconsider the rules.""

The plant makes electromagnetic coils and other electronic products. It was closed Tuesday, said a man who answered at the plant but refused to identify himself. He said no workers were on strike and staff would return to work on Wednesday.

Strikes have become commonplace in China, as factories operating in highly competitive markets try to get more productivity from their labor force and workers connected by mobile phones and the Internet become more aware of their rights.

Shinmei Electric's statement didn't say specifically what the workers were protesting, but said management reforms and labor policies were believed to be a cause. It said talks were under way with workers at the plant and that police were questioning staff.

A man who refused to give his name from the press office of the Shanghai police bureau said he had no information about the incident and referred calls to the Shanghai government press office, where calls rang unanswered.

From the South China Morning Post:

More than 1,000 furious migrant workers besieged a factory in Shanghai and held 18 Japanese and Chinese managers against their will for more than a day, after the workers were required to abide by unequal regulations.

The workers of Japanese electronic appliance maker Shanghai Shinmei Electric staged a strike and besieged the factory for two days, starting around 8am on Friday morning, following the introduction of a new factory policy calling for heavy fines, demerits or immediate termination for workers who made a mistake, the Japan-based Asahi Shimbun reported yesterday.

At least one Chinese manager with hypertension passed out after being forcibly detained along with the 17 others - seven Chinese and 10 Japanese - in two office rooms between Friday and Saturday. The company's president, Hideaki Tamura, was among those held.

On Saturday night, more than 400 Shanghai police officers freed the managers.

Tamura told the Asahi Shimbun by phone that more than 500 workers besieged his office, and the managers were not allowed to use the toilet. Tamura was locked in his office with six other Japanese managers and five Chinese, while the remaining six were locked in another room.

The report said the factory's new disciplinary policy was part of a reform scheme after the appliance maker was acquired by a Chinese company last year.

Angry workers were cited by the BBC as saying that the new factory regulations, with what they said were 49 unequal clauses, triggered the protest.

Another assembly worker, who declined to be named, said they were also angry over the acquisition. She said workers feared that they would no longer enjoy the benefits accumulated in their previous years working in the factory after they signed a new contract following the acquisition by a Chinese firm in Dalian, Liaoning province.

She said that several of her colleagues were injured when the anti-riot police rushed into the factory. One worker allegedly suffered broken ribs and another suffered a head injury.

Join Paul Baines (founder of the Great Lakes Commons Map) to see and hear how we can use maps, digital tools, and storytelling to shift into a new possibility for water stewardship. Open source technologies, collaborative practices, and a commons ethic are the connecting elements of this work and it's time for this project to be shared and shaped by more people - like you.

Video recorded at the event is now attached. 

Going far back enough in history, the impossible has already happened. The Great Lakes are the earth's largest surface fresh water body and are now toxic, invaded, dying, and dropping. The amount of water in this watershed is so massive, it takes 350 years for water to fully flow through it's west-to-east basin (Lake Superior to the St. Lawrence Seaway). On top of new and increasing impacts, most of the existing damage has happened in just 2 generations.

Is it possible to change this new norm? Are the existing values, policies, and actions part of the solution or part of the problem? A paradigm shift is needed, but how do we name and built it? Maps tell stories and stories give our lives meaning and direction. So how do we transform the maps?

The Great Lakes Commons Map was inspired by the work of many other water warriors who are re-imagining and re-indigenizing our relationship with the Great Lakes. Join us at the Academy for an overview of this project and a collaborative and curious discussion.",2014-05-04T05:34:46.479204,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Toronto', 'adminArea5': 'Toronto', 'streetAddress': '247 Wallace Ave', 'postalCode': 'M6H 1V5', 'formattedAddress': '247 Wallace Ave, Toronto, ON M6H 1V5, Canada'}, 'coords': [-79.446431, 43.661903]}",z-9urOVnSICukw_hzzwhOw,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-01-17T17:18:00.000Z,36776-80,ushahidi,Impossible Event,"[{'name': 'Healing', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:29:27.609679,Canada,ON,Toronto,Toronto,"247 Wallace Ave, Toronto, ON M6H 1V5, Canada",M6H 1V5,247 Wallace Ave,"{'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Toronto', 'adminArea5': 'Toronto', 'streetAddress': '247 Wallace Ave', 'postalCode': 'M6H 1V5', 'formattedAddress': '247 Wallace Ave, Toronto, ON M6H 1V5, Canada'}","[-79.446431, 43.661903]",43.661903,-79.446431,Healing,,,en
2014-05-09 19:28:32.376645,"A group calling itself Translator Syrian posted a video to YouTube on January 17 in which a woman recounts her imprisonment and torture at the hands of pro-government forces, as well as the rape of a 16-year-old activist she was detained with. 

The interviewer identifies the woman as a free woman from Hama. The woman says she believes she was arrested because of her work nursing wounded rebels. Describing how she was taken from her home by “Assad’s thugs” and transported to the detention center, she says: “They started torturing me while we were still in the armored vehicle.”

Once at the prison, she was subjected for three days to “shabh,” a hanging torture technique in which the victim’s hands are tied to the ceiling. “They also used electricity against me,” she says. “They lashed me with electric cables. They hit women with electric cables! They gave me electric shocks.”

A 55-year-old woman faced the same torture, and a 16-year-old media activist was raped by her jailers, according to the video. There were 9-year-old children held in the same facility, arrested because they had written on walls, the woman says. 

Translator Syrian identifies itself as “a group of independent young people” with the goal to “distribute and publicize the crimes of Bashar al-Assad against the unarmed Syrian people to the whole world.” 

The date and location of the reported rape is unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:24:32.011893,,"{'addressComponents': {'formattedAddress': 'Hamah, Syria'}, 'coords': [36.752449, 35.13781]}",UOHerlWZTtS0oy1m_LfXAw,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-01-17T06:56:00.000Z,34369-150,ushahidi,Former prisoner gives account of torture and rape in Hama detention center,"[{'name': '3GF.

In Egypt at the Dahshour necropolis, modern cemetery expansion and looting are putting the much older pharaonic necropolis at risk. The <a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=169358525"" target=""_blank"">AP reports</a> that the locals are building new tombs, police are unable to enforce regulations and secure the site. But worst of all the piece speculates that the new Islamist regime holds little respect for the ancient past. Here's a flavor:<br />

<i>In the case of Dahshour, villagers say their cemeteries are full and authorities don't give permits or land for new ones. So they took matters into their own hands and grabbed what they insist is empty desert to erect family tombs.

""The dearest thing for us is burying our dead,"" said Mohammed Abdel-Qader, a resident of nearby Manshiet Dahshour. ""This land here is wide and flat, it's a valley. Where are the antiquities they talk about? ... We have no antiquities here.""</i></div>
<div>
<i>. . .</i></div>
<div>
<i>The cemetery expansion is the most dangerous encroachment yet because of how close it comes to the Dahshour monuments, which are on the UNESCO World Heritage site list, Younes said. Moreover, Dahshour is largely unexcavated, since the area was a closed military zone until 1996. What remains buried is believed to be a treasure trove shedding light on the largely unknown early dynasties.

""When you build something over archaeological site, you change everything. We can't dig in and know what is inside,"" Younes told The Associated Press. ""This is the only virgin site in all of Egypt."" </i></div>
</blockquote>
<br />
 The story notes that the construction of new tombs, though illegal, may also be cover for looting. The piece paints a troubling picture. Consider the difficult time Egyptian officials must have had in protecting and preserving a site like this. They must weigh the concerns of angry local populations, be wary of the more dangerous antiquities looters, and also work to preserve the site.<div>Questions or Comments?

2014-05-09 19:28:32.200276,"Three witnesses to an alleged January 16 massacre in Al Huswayieh reported the rape of 42 women and girls from their town in a video that was posted by a number of users to YouTube two days later. Al Huswayieh is located near the Al Qusayr district, just south of Homs. Various news sources have reported that government forces killed more than 100 people in Homs on the same day as the massacre in the small town. 

The video shows three women, faces kept entirely covered, seated side-by-side and crying. A man, off camera, introduces the clip, saying that because no journalists were present, the massacre was not reported to the press. “These are the testimonies of some survivors,” he says. 

One woman begins: “We were in our homes. At 7 a.m. they entered town. Their heads were wrapped. They were not in the regular army. They were carrying hatchets and bottles of arak [an alcoholic drink] and they started slaughtering, skinning, killing.”

She describes how shabiha (plainclothes militia) members shot men and cattle in the fields, burned children, and took whole families away. A woman, nine months pregnant and mother to four, was shot while holding her 11-year-old son, the woman says. 

All money, mobile phones, and jewelry were confiscated, the woman says, but “if a woman did not have money or jewelry they would strip and rape her.” 

“Forty-two girls and women were raped in front of us, and from 7 until 8 we were used as human shields,” she says. “This is a massacre and a crime with no precedent.”

When the other women spoke they related the same stories, but did not mention the alleged rapes again. The second half of the video contained no audio. 

The exact location of the reported rapes is unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:24:30.892215,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea1': 'Syria', 'formattedAddress': 'Syria'}, 'coords': [36.576469, 34.511669]}",QJ2XI0qQRJmRZUYkiGCzxg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-01-16T09:45:00.000Z,34369-151,ushahidi,Witnesses say shabiha forces raped 42 women and girls in Al Huswayieh,"[{'name': '3SF.

<span></span>BBC Radio Suffolk had a focus on Icklingham today [<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p012rql8"">iPlayer</a>: final 10 minutes]. I was invited to say a few words about the Icklingham bronzes and their surfacing in New York. I reminded the listeners about how they were removed from the ground and what information had been lost. Interestingly one of the bronzes was displayed in a temporary exhibition at Harvard.<br />
<br />
Shelby White, the present proprietor of the bronzes, has indicated that she intends to leave the bronzes to the British Museum. But our hope is that she will return them to be displayed in the Ipswich Museum or another collection in Suffolk.<br />

<span></span>The J.

The press release makes it clear that comparative material was found at Morgantina and that fragments from the hair were found in a sanctuary confirming its original location.<br />
<br />
The press release tells us that the head was acquired in 1985. Daniel Ng and Jason Felch (""<a href=""http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-getty-museum-hades-sculpture-sicily-20130110,0,2715069.story"">Getty Museum to return Hades terracotta head to Sicily</a>"", <i>LA Times</i> January 10, 2013) inform us that it was acquired from Maurice Tempelsman. The original source was Robin Symes. Why did the Getty omit this part of the collecting history?<br />
<br />
This raises the question about other material in the Getty that was sourced from Robin Symes.<br />

2014-05-09 19:28:31.669830,"Khetam Bneyan, a 19-year-old Syrian activist and law student, attested to the rape of one of her prison mates and the torture and brutalization of many more during her weeks-long detainment in a government facility. Women’s eNews first posted Bneyan’s narrative, which was translated with her permission from a Facebook post, on February 6, and the Daily Beast’s Women in the World wrote about her ordeal on March 10. According to Women's eNews, Bneyan was released from detention on January 9.

Bneyan, who identified herself to the Daily Beast as a nonviolent protester, said she was imprisoned after she stood holding a sign that read “Only in Syria: the thinking mind is imprisoned.” The date of her arrest is not specified, but she was reportedly freed on January 9 as part of a mass prisoner exchange “involving several thousand Syrians and 48 Iranian hostages.” 

“Twenty-two days after getting out of prison, or living hell,” she wrote on February 3. “Twenty-two days, I’ve been close to total hysteria from what happened.” She wrote that people keep telling her that these feelings will pass and that in a few days’ time she will be able to forget. But, “it hasn’t passed,” she wrote, “and I haven’t forgotten what has happened, and what is happening in there now, still, right this very minute.” 

At 2 a.m. one morning, a 25-year-old fellow detainee identified by Bneyan as Um Tim, was ordered by the deputy to his office, she said. 

“You could tell that something had happened to her,” Bneyan told the Daily Beast, because the young woman came back from questioning wearing different clothing and subsequently broke protocol by spending the next few hours in the bathroom. Over the course of these hours, Um Tim described her ordeal to Bneyan. She was allegedly raped twice by a Syrian Army military captain, who targeted her with “special, provocative treatment” because she was known to be married to a man working for the Free Syrian Army. Bneyan stated that the regime was seeking FSA locations, positions, brigade names, and plans from her. 

The captain forced her onto a bed, tying her arms and legs to keep her down, Bneyan said. “When he started to rape her, she started to scream,” Bneyan said, “He said, ‘no one will help you.’ And then he opened the door, so everyone [other prison guards] could heard. He said, ‘See? No one’s going to help you.’ He then said, ‘you must confess and you must help us. Confess.’ This was after the first time.”

At this point in her story, Bneyan recalled, Um Tim broke down. “I haven’t forgotten her face, her tears, her ‘oh God, oh God,” Bneyan wrote for Women’s eNews. Bneyan said that after the young woman was raped, she would repeat “no oppression stays forever” over and over to herself in the cell. 

Her fellow prisoner’s attack came at a time where Bneyan had been growing “less worried” about the prospect of rape in detention, she said, which she referred to as her “biggest fear.” After almost three weeks in jail without being threatened or seeing any other inmates threatened, the probability of the act seemed diminished. Though she was not raped of sexually violated in any way, Bneyan herself was interrogated for 12 hours and threatened with solitary confinement throughout her imprisonment, she said. She also vividly remembers the ways in which the women around her were continuously tortured and abused: 

“I haven’t forgotten the voice of Wala Kayyal, 20 years old,” Bneyan wrote, “when she told me, ‘Look at my back; he beat my back.’ I haven’t forgotten the beat marks and bruises on your back, Wala.” 

“I haven’t forgotten how your body spasmed, Alham from al-Muhasan, when you went into your first epileptic fit, or how the warden spewed curses at you, ‘You’re faking, get up, you nothing.”

“I haven’t forgotten the face of Mona al-Wadi when they told her she would be executed the following day at 10 a.m.”
 
She ends her first-person narrative with a promise: “I will not forget these women. They are in a living death behind bars. Be with them, God.” 

The date and location of the reported rape is unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:24:29.762827,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea1': 'Syria', 'formattedAddress': 'Syria'}, 'coords': [38.996815, 34.802075]}",dN0kcnReR8yllEge6bKsLA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-01-09T12:55:00.000Z,34369-174,ushahidi,Activist Khetam Bneyan describes rape of fellow prisoner in Syrian government facility,"[{'name': '3GF.

In early 2011, the homeowners replaced the lawn with a meadow comprised mostly of native plants and grasses.  They were inspired by ""American Meadow"" designs by John Greenlee and wanted to create a natural-looking, water-wise ecosystem that incorporated the three principles of an Ocean Friendly Garden: conservation, permeability and retention. They kept existing mature Camellias and trees and planted a variety of California native and climate appropriate grasses, bulbs, ferns and flowering perennials that thrive in clay soil, provide wildlife habitat and bloom at various times during the year.
  A swale in the front yard is the main attraction with its colorful Iris, Coral Bells, and Meadow Foam blooms. Wildlife activity has noticeably increased since the meadow installation, not only in terms of birds, lizards, insects, spiders, but also under the surface, as earthworm populations have grown thanks to a heavy layer of mulch that suppresses weeds and feeds the soil biology. Maintenance needs are minimal, involving monthly weeding, quarterly applications of compost tea and semiannual pruning, so we have time to relax and enjoy the garden. No use of chemical fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, blowers, mowers or weed whackers is needed; the garden thrives on its own and provides a healthy and attractive environment.
  Irrigation consists of both drip irrigation and mini rotators with a ""smart"" controller that schedules watering times based upon real-time weather information. This has resulted in significant water savings compared to the former lawn. Other site features to retain water include a decomposed granite center strip in the driveway, two infiltration pits in the back yard, and rain barrels.",2014-05-04T05:41:43.592199,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'CA', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Los Angeles Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Los Angeles', 'streetAddress': '11972 Palms Blvd', 'postalCode': '90066', 'formattedAddress': '11972 Palms Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90066'}, 'coords': [-118.433918, 34.013127]}",Q3_pqqizSE69nX22O6c1qg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-01-09T01:47:00.000Z,12605-124,ushahidi,"Mar Vista, CA (Los Angeles) - residence","[{'name': 'Retention - Downspout Re-direct', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Permeability - Healthy Living Soil', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Permeability - Permeable Hardscape', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Retention - Sponge Gardens', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Conservation - Irrigation', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Conservation - Mulch', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Conservation - Plants', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:30:01.457536,United States,CA,Los Angeles Co.,Los Angeles,"11972 Palms Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90066",90066,11972 Palms Blvd,"{'adminArea3': 'CA', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Los Angeles Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Los Angeles', 'streetAddress': '11972 Palms Blvd', 'postalCode': '90066', 'formattedAddress': '11972 Palms Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90066'}","[-118.433918, 34.013127]",34.013127,-118.433918,Retention - Downspout Re-direct,Permeability - Healthy Living Soil,Permeability - Permeable Hardscape,en

2014-05-09 19:07:44.746971,"Globally, there are a large number discussions pertaining to  designing and building  smart and intelligent cities of tomorrow, we often tend to ignore  one of the most vital infrastructure which make them beautiful, healthy and sustainable to  live viz. the public toilets. 
Most of the cities of India   are now reeling under large migrations from the rural areas and inadequate sanitation causes more harm to the environment and ecosystem of these upcoming cities.  Kerala, the southernmost state of India, has the highest population density is known  as one of the most progressive states, high physical quality of life index, but paradoxically it is home to  a number of diseases caused due to  polluted water bodies, inadequate sanitation facilities. 
Incidentally Kerala   is the first state in India to install electronic public toilets.  This patent pending product e-toilet have automated from entry to sewage treatment, and operates on sensor based technology. These technologies make the e-toilets conserve power and water, keep them clean and hygienic all the time and provide the  performance status of the units  on  web based interface. This unique feature of the e-toilets provide more transparency and accountability  towards the  public infrastructure developed by the local Government bodies under the three tier system of Governance, which empower people democracy at the grassroots. The  convergence of electronics, web and mobile technologies make the toilets  a next generation public sanitation infrastructure. 
Now, these e-toilets are connected over a GPRS network and is called as Connected e-toilet  Infrastructure (CeTI).  These network of e-toilets would empower the decision makers of the emerging cities in India to manage and monitor the performance of their public sanitation infrastructure. First CeTI in India is operational in Pathanamthitta district of Kerala, with 26 e-toilets connected over a GPRS network. A traveller can access the e-toilet map over a web interface and can view the locations of e-toilets in his itinerary and plan on her halts, ahead of her journey. This is one element of MESH Cities which we envisage to build and would make the lives of its citizens and tourists much more better.",2014-05-04T04:49:34.515508,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'Kerala', 'adminArea1': 'India', 'adminArea4': 'Pathanamthitta', 'adminArea5': 'Pathanamthitta', 'streetAddress': 'Pathanamthitta Thzhoorkadavu Road', 'formattedAddress': 'Pathanamthitta Thzhoorkadavu Road, Thazhevettipram, Pathanamthitta, India'}, 'coords': [76.787041, 9.264758]}",K--5iK2xQI-BMAPgvijyYw,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2013-01-07T01:39:00.000Z,24670-143,ushahidi,Connected etoilet Infrastructure,"[{'name': 'MESH/Smart City Infrastructure', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:07:44.746971,India,Kerala,Pathanamthitta,Pathanamthitta,"Pathanamthitta Thzhoorkadavu Road, Thazhevettipram, Pathanamthitta, India",,Pathanamthitta Thzhoorkadavu Road,"{'adminArea3': 'Kerala', 'adminArea1': 'India', 'adminArea4': 'Pathanamthitta', 'adminArea5': 'Pathanamthitta', 'streetAddress': 'Pathanamthitta Thzhoorkadavu Road', 'formattedAddress': 'Pathanamthitta Thzhoorkadavu Road, Thazhevettipram, Pathanamthitta, India'}","[76.787041, 9.264758]",9.264758,76.787041,MESH/Smart City Infrastructure,,,en

The district is located in a governate of the same name in northwestern Syria. 

FARS provides no further information on this specific assault but says, “Terrorists have tried hard in the last few weeks to make Syrian cities unsafe, especially for citizens,” and describes the efforts of the army to kill and arrest members of these opposition groups. 

The exact location of the reported rapes is unknown.

Analysis of such data can provide critical information on the impact of remote, isolated conflicts on civilians, environmental and social justice issues, indigenous rights, and more. Geospatial technologies can broaden the ability of non-governmental organizations to rapidly gather, analyze, and disseminate authoritative information, especially during times of crisis.

2014-05-09 19:28:31.768388,"A woman named Abir, 35, recounted to Omar Al-Jeblawi, media spokesman for the Revolutionaries of Jableh, her abduction and incarceration at several security branches over four months within the Latakia and Damascus areas, and her subsequent torture and sexual harassment. 

Abir told Al-Jeblawi she believes she was abducted and detained for watching an anti-regime TV program in a predominantly Alawite neighborhood. She said she thinks her neighbors, many of whom are officers, informed on her when they heard her watching Salafist Sheikh Adnan al-Aroor on TV. In January 2013 or a little before that, she was ambushed early in the morning on her way to work on the Jableh-Latakia highway, he said; a Political Security Intelligence car pulled up and arrested her. She said she believes she was taken to Military Intelligence Branch 235 (also known as the Palestine Security Branch) in Damascus. 

She was detained for four months and was moved through several branches including State Security, Military Security, and Adra Prison (all in Damascus), she said. She stated that when she was moved from branch to branch she would be tortured for the first two weeks each time and then left alone. During her first three months in detention, Abir told Al-Jeblawi, she was hung by her wrists with her toes barely touching the floor, a stress position known as shabeh. While suspended, Abir endured insults, beatings with sticks, and electrocution. 
 
While detained, Abir stated that she endured groping and harassment but that she was not raped, though attempts were made—she said her screaming and physical resistance kept her attackers from actually raping her.
 
Abir told Al-Jeblawi that she heard about the rape of others during her detention. She said she believes that more than 25 women and girls from all over the country were being held in the Palestine Branch when she was there. All were tortured, she said; some were sexually violated and some were raped, “especially if they were good looking.” According to Abir, rape would not occur in the cell; rather, the girl would come back from an interrogation room crying and would describe the rape. In some instances, the perpetrator would say, “Let’s see what you’re going to do with yourself now,” women told her.

2014-05-09 19:28:32.896539,"A report issued by the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network on November 25 documents rape and the use of women as human shields or hostages in Syria. 

The report tells the story of Aida, a 19-year-old woman from the Syrian coastal city of Tartus, who was detained from October 2012 until January 2013 and was allegedly raped two different times during her detainment at two different centers—one of the attacks involved gang rape by three soldiers at the military security branch in Tartus:

“The interrogator left me in the room and came back with three personnel who took turns raping me,” Aida is quoted as saying. “I fiercely resisted the first but when the second started, I became more terrified and couldn't resist. When the third started, I totally collapsed. I was bleeding all the time. As the last one finished, I fell on the ground. Ten minutes later, the prison doctor came in and took me to the bathroom where he gave me an injection to enable me to stand before the judge.”

The other rape, Aida told the organization, was perpetrated by two security personnel at the military security branch in Damascus known as the Palestine Branch. After this attack, she was hospitalized:

“On the fifth day, two members of the security unit came and raped me. I had never seen them in the first four days. When they approached me, I told them that I am not a virgin thinking that they will let go away. .... These two members took turn in raping me and after they finished I fainted and fell on the ground. Then, they moved me to a military police hospital in Damascus and contacted my family to tell them that I was dead.” 

The exact dates of the reported assaults are unknown.

2014-05-09 19:28:33.421250,"During an interview with WMC’s Women Under Siege, an administrator at a rehabilitation center in southern Turkey described the case of a student activist who came to the area from Syria seeking an abortion after being raped. 

The student activist, 20, arrived alone in February, having been smuggled out of Syria and connected with medical professionals through informal resistance networks. She was allegedly attacked on the second floor of a quiet university building by a security guard at the Idlib University campus; the guard was said to be part of a school security staff provided by the Syrian army.

A gynecological exam performed by an ob-gyn confirmed that the student activist was 40 days pregnant, too late for a legal early-stage termination, according to the administrator. Arrangements were made for a clandestine procedure—the pregnancy was aborted, and the student activist returned to Syria, he said.

According to the hospital administrator, her family was aware neither of the assault nor the subsequent abortion.

The exact date of the reported rape is unknown.

2014-05-09 19:28:31.857359,"A woman named Maha, 37, from Deir Ba’alba told WMC’s Women Under Siege in May about a sugar factory in Homs she says is being used to hold women and girls as sexual slaves. 

“They picked beautiful girls for generals and then gave them to the soldiers,” Maha said. 

She said she knows people who worked in the factory and witnessed what was happening there. 

“Whoever leaves the village has to go through a checkpoint next to the factory,” Maha said. “They take the girls at the checkpoint. The girls get killed. They disappear.” She said she did not know how many girls had been abducted.

(For more on this report and related stories about rape at Syrian sugar factories, see: http://www.womenundersiegeproject.org/blog/entry/tracking-a-rumor-is-there-a-sugar-factory-in-syria-being-used-as-a-rape-hou)

Maha, who fled Syria just after a massacre by shabiha (plainclothes militia) forces in her town, now lives in Amman with her husband and nine of her children. One son, 23, remains in Syria. 

The whole village fled during the massacre, which was around New Year’s Eve, Maha said. When she and her family reached a checkpoint, the army dragged away 10 female members of her family, she said. Among them were women aged 40, 36, 35, 16, and 15. The younger girls were her brother’s daughters. She said she witnessed a man’s son shot and being left to die in the chaos and that her brother was shot while looking for his daughters.

The London-based independent Syrian Human Rights Committee reported on December 29, 2012: “Human rights activists have reported that the district of Deir Ba’alba in Homs has witnessed a horrific massacre in which more than 220 civilians have been killed, following an attack on the area by Syrian regime forces and its Shabiha gangs.” (http://www.shrc.org/data/aspx/d16/4986.aspx)

2014-05-09 19:28:32.624696,"In a recording that opens with the subtitle, “From Hafez to Bashar, a Bloody History,” an Alawite woman gives an eyewitness account of the sexualized torture and murder carried out at what she says was the behest of the government near the summer home of Rami Makhlouf, the cousin of Bashar al-Assad. 

“I never expected this level of deception,” she begins. “The crimes of the regime are huge. I have seen it with my own eyes, and I am suffering from that.” The witness, who works nearby, explains that one day she heard wailing sound. A guard told her a woman was mourning the death of her son who had fought for the regime. He then divulged that that they were keeping four girls prisoner in a room so that women like the grieving mother could be taken to them and vent their anger. Telling him she would like a chance to do the same, the witness struck a bargain with the guard: He would take her to the location at noon the next day on the condition that she served him lunch, as she did in her job. 

Although she had informers who were keeping her apprised of crimes the regime was committing, she says, she admits this kind of activity was never mentioned and that she “did not expect this to take place in this house that was so close to where I was working.” 

Even so, tales from an informant would not have prepared her for what she saw, she says. The four girls, naked and covered with blood, were 16, 17, 18, and 20 years old, she recounted. “Their heads barely had any hair. They were bleeding.” She asked the guard what the stench in the room was, and he said it was the smell of their menstruation and excretions. 

“In my heart I cursed him and his mother,” she said. “I felt my heart crying for them. I looked at one and pretended that I would hurt her, saying, ‘I want to step on you with my feet but you smell so disgusting.’ They looked at me and I think they could tell I didn’t mean it. They sensed I was not like the others.” 

The guard said all four of the girls had come from Homs. He told the witness about a pregnant woman who had died in birth, along with the infant, and how they left her body in the house with the girls for seven days. He told her they fed the girls old bread and water mixed with the guards’ own urine. When the witness asked when they would let the girls go, he replied that once they were no longer of use, once they “expired,” they would “throw them out and get other girls.” The girls were needed, he explained, to “calm down these howling women” who had lost their husbands, sons, and brothers to the opposition. The witness recalls asking one such woman how a girl could be faulted for her relative’s participation in the uprising. The woman replied, “I want to take it out on them.” 

She says the floor was wet and cold and that she can’t forget the smell. She says she wanted to know how her employer could allow for this to happen on his property, and the guard simply answered, “We have the green light.” 

The video was posted to YouTube by a political group focused on the Syrian revolution and Arab Spring called the NoraNews Network on December 23, 2012, but the date of the recording and the date and exact location of the reported torture are unknown.

2014-05-09 19:28:32.808390,"An article in the Calgary Herald on December 22 interviewed nine children, their aunt, and their grandmother who fled Dara’a and now live together in a small room in Kabelias, Lebanon. Aunt Ikhlass, 36, said the situation is less than ideal, “But it’s better than dying. It’s better than losing your honor, when they break into houses and pick on the women and girls. We heard that the soldiers would take a girl and strip her naked, rape her, and then kill her later on.” 

She said that neighbors still in her home city have told stories of a four-month-old child being raped and dying, and of male family members forced to watch the gang-rape of female relatives. The article additionally cited Nadim Khoury, Human Rights Watch’s deputy director for the Middle East, who said male prisoners are also victims of rape as a form of torture and demoralization. 

The family is struggling in Lebanon. Eight of the nine children, whose ages range between 16 and 2, are girls, and the eldest, Marwa, has began to work to pay their rent. Lacking fuel for their indoor wood-burning stove, Ikhlass says she cooks their meals on a propane burner outside. “I try to pretend like we’re on a really long picnic,” she told the reporter. “But sometimes I think death would be easier, but not rape.”

The individual, Muhammad Abdullah Dawoud, is a policeman from the Ministry of Interior. He says the majority of his assignments were under Brig. Gen. Talal Alaisami, who allegedly gave orders for his men to break into homes, take valuables, and rape women in Al Hrak, Inkhil, and Dara’a. Dawoud also states that he participated in break-ins in Dara’a, Jisreen, and Eastern Ghota. 

Dawoud and nine other men entered a house in Al Hrak where four women were present, he says in the video. They raped them, slaughtered one, and burned the other three, he says. After this admission the interrogator loses his temper and shouts at Dawoud, slapping him as he asks, “How did you do that? Would you allow that to happen to your sister?”

The video was posted to YouTube by a news group named Homs24Net on December 21, 2012, but the date and exact location of the reported rapes is unknown.

2014-05-09 19:28:33.000929,"Mahmoud Slaibi, a member of the shabiha, or plainclothes militia forces, says in a video that he committed a number of crimes in Damascus, including the rape of four women. 

The logo shown at the beginning of the clip identifies the group responsible for the video as the Umayyad Battalion from Al Islam Brigade. Their crest reads: “We are people honored by adhering to Islam, whenever we seek honor elsewhere, degradation and servility is what we get.” A separate user posted the video to YouTube on December 13, 2012. 

Slaibi, who said he was stationed at the first road block on Nisreen Street in the At Tadamon neighborhood, stated that he is a civilian and was paid 1,500 Syrian pounds (US$21) daily, plus whatever he stole, to join the shabiha. He revealed that during his time as a militia member he and four of his friends raped four married women in the Zubair Bin Al-Awam Mosque. 

When asked by his interrogators if he had killed any children, Slaibi denies this charge but states that he killed a 17-year-old and four other individuals. He also says he broke into stores, stealing merchandise and committing arson.

2014-05-09 19:28:33.253371,"Syria Online TV, a state-owned news source, posted a video to YouTube on December 10, 2012, that features a confession of rape from a member of an opposition group referred to as “Abdulhadi’s gang.” 

The speaker is introduced as Mahmoud al-Akkari, born in 1978 in Talbiseh, a suburb of Homs. He says that he, Abdulhadi al-Akkari—to whom his relationship is not specified—and Sheikh Zakariyya al-Dakka agreed to join ongoing Talbiseh protests. He then proceeds to describe the range of crimes he and “Abdulhadi’s gang” allegedly committed, including the kidnapping of “five girls from different neighborhoods.” He goes on to say that the group “took them to the farm, where they raped and murdered them.” He does not specify where this farm is located.

Many of the group’s other alleged activities align with potential state propaganda: Al-Akkari details how they shot at protesters from behind so they could later accuse security forces of the attack, and that they deliberately sought to block borders in order to “stir up chaos” between Syria and Turkey.

It is located in the broad Al-Biqāʿ (Bekaa Valley) region, at an elevation of roughly 3,700 feet (1,130 metres) about 50 miles (80 km) east-northeast of Beirut. The complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1984.

One of the principal structures on the site is the Temple of Jupiter (completed 2nd century ce), only portions of which remain. It was a massive building, entered by a propylaea, or entranceway, leading to a hexagonal forecourt and then to a rectangular main court 343 feet (104.5 metres) long and 338 feet (103 metres) wide.

2014-05-09 19:28:33.587441,"On April 9, the Paris-based nonprofit International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) released a report that detailed multiple alleged acts of sexualized violence in Syria. FIDH collected testimonies from refugees, supporting organizations, and Syrian human rights activists during an international fact-finding mission in December 2012 that was carried out in cooperation with the Jordan-based nonprofit Arab Women Organization.

In an interview with FIDH on December 19, 2012, a Syrian man gave his eyewitness account to the torture and sexualized violence he had seen enacted against three female detainees. He said he had been picked up in rural Damascus three times by pro-regime forces, and was held at the Al-Khatib Security Branch in Damascus for one period of incarceration. While there, he witnessed three female university students forced to strip completely in front of the 42 prisoners while being subjected to insults and sexual talk, he said. One of the girls was forced to strip after refusing remove her underwear because she was menstruating. 

“They were made to bend down and stand up, then the men approached them and began to grope them and make gestures toward them,” the man said. “Their bodies showed they had been beaten.” 

The man told FIDH that he later learned that the girls had been brought over from the counter-terrorism security branch. He said the girls’ harassment in front of the prisoners went on for about 15 minutes and that he thinks the demonstration was meant as a threat.

“In the barracks I was in, most of the prisoners were kept in isolation, known for their problems with security personnel,” he said. “I think they made us especially watch what happened with the girls as a kind of threat, to let us know that the same thing would happen to ‘our women’ if we continued our anti-regime activity.”

He also told FIDH: “Sometimes they burned me with a candle or a lighter on sensitive parts of my body. I was also subjected to torture that degraded me as a man.”

The dates of the reported rapes are unknown.

2014-05-09 19:30:01.884250,"The Newport Chapter of Surfrider Foundation, Lincoln Soil and Water Conservation District  and the City of Newport designed and planted an Ocean Friendly Garden project for Newport City Hall. The project began with a rain garden workshop that the chapter hosted in partnership with OSU and the above partners. The City of Newport identified stormwater infrastructure which needed replacement to connect to City Hall downspouts. The Ocean Friendly Garden project was conceived to take the place of such costly stormwater piping and infrastructure, while also redirecting stormwater for retention on site. A 6' x 160' garden was designed to receive all of the rain water from city hall and downspouts were redirected to the garden for retaining and filtering the roof runoff. The existing soil was amended to increase permeability to a depth of 4', due to the large volume of water and roof drainage area (over 5,000 sq. ft). The garden's size, permeability and location was all engineered utilizing volunteers and partners and the Surfrider Ocean Friendly Gardens how-to guide. Over 200 native plants were planted to encourage native wildlife and require little to no maintenance and watering after the first year of establishment. The project costs were considerable due to the concrete curbs that surround the garden and redirect downspouts. The curb was put in primarily to make City of Newport maintenance around the garden easier.",2014-05-04T05:41:42.422391,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'OR', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Lincoln Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Newport', 'streetAddress': '8 SE 2nd St', 'postalCode': '97365', 'formattedAddress': '8 SE 2nd St, Newport, OR 97365'}, 'coords': [-124.053241, 44.634472]}",Q96q5C3NSPeu8zsXoCNIBA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2012-12-18T22:41:00.000Z,12605-122,ushahidi,"Newport, Oregon City Hall Ocean Friendly Garden","[{'name': 'Retention - Downspout Re-direct', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Permeability - Healthy Living Soil', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Retention - Sponge Gardens', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Conservation - Irrigation', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Conservation - Mulch', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Conservation - Plants', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:30:01.884250,United States,OR,Lincoln Co.,Newport,"8 SE 2nd St, Newport, OR 97365",97365,8 SE 2nd St,"{'adminArea3': 'OR', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Lincoln Co.', 'adminArea5': 'Newport', 'streetAddress': '8 SE 2nd St', 'postalCode': '97365', 'formattedAddress': '8 SE 2nd St, Newport, OR 97365'}","[-124.053241, 44.634472]",44.634472,-124.053241,Retention - Downspout Re-direct,Permeability - Healthy Living Soil,Retention - Sponge Gardens,en

2014-05-09 19:28:32.717817,"NoraNews, a network whose coverage focuses on the Syrian revolution, posted a video to YouTube on December 16, 2012, that appears to document a shabiha (plainclothes militia) member’s coerced confession to participating in the gang rape of a 15-year-old girl in Dayr al-Zawr. 

The footage shows the shabiha combatant being questioned and beaten by a member of the opposition, whose face has been obscured, as he relates the circumstances of the assault. 

OPPOSITION: This rapist thug was arrested. This is to take revenge for our sisters who they raped. By God’s permission, this will happen to everyone who did this act. What do you want to tell Bashar al-Assad? 
PRISONER: May God deem him a failure. He is the one who got us in this calamity. I pray he dies. Please, for the sake of Allah. 
OPPOSITION: A few more slaps and I will be done. Don’t run away. Aren’t you ashamed of yourself to say, “For the sake of Allah?” Didn’t the girl you raped say that? Tell me. Don’t lie. 
PRISONER: I was in Dayr al-Zawr, Branch 466, military work. I participated in break-ins with Col. Ali Muhammad Alahmad. We entered a building and found three young girls. The colonel liked one of them. He raped her first and then asked us to rape her. 
OPPOSITION: What did the girl do or say?
PRISONER: She was begging and saying, “For the sake of Allah.”
OPPOSITION: Despite that, you all raped her. How many were you?
PRISONER: We were eight. I was the last one. 
OPPOSITION: Give me all their names. 
PRISONER: Ahmad Ramadan, Ahmad Ghanem, Haytham. I do not know the rest. My name is Ali Izzat Annajjar. I think she was in 10th grade. 
OPPOSITION: So she was around 15 years old. She could have been your sister. Can you imagine that done to your sister? How can you do that to someone else’s sister? 
PRISONER: I swear by God I was forced to do it. 
OPPOSITION: You were forced? Your erection was forced? And what about the photos on the memory card on your mobile phone? Are you so proud of yourself? 
PRISONER: Just ordinary photos, I swear. I was the last one to rape her. The colonel told me to go in. I told him this is unfair to the girl. But he forced me. They were all standing and watching. 
OPPOSITION: So you took off your pants and did it in front of them and in front of her family? 
PRISONER: Her family was not at home. They ran away before we arrived, I guess. 
OPPOSITION: How about the other two girls? 
PRISONER: They were raped by Ahmad Ramadan, Ahmad Ghanem, and Haytham. Only those three. 
OPPOSITION: And who burned the girl?
PRISONER: She was not burned. 
OPPOSITION: Why is she in the hospital?
ANOTHER OPPOSITION MEMBER: Is Ahmad Ramadan still alive?

In the following statement, the man says he raped three women himself: 

“I am Sergeant Maher Ahmad Muhammad, from the headquarters of the III Corps. I am from Tall Shenan village and I am an Alawite. 

""We went into Baba Amr (Homs) in the third month. Orders to enter with force came from Brigadier General Issam Zahruddin, Brigadier General Nabil Elkhatib, and General Wajih Mahmoud. They wanted a cover for the military security forces and the air force intelligence personnel. 

""They gathered the civilians at a distance and Issam Zahruddin ordered us to shoot all of them. We shot them all. Then, they took us to different halls filled with women. Two hours earlier, they had given each of us two tablets of Zemax, a sexual stimulant, to swallow. They ordered us to rape the women. I raped three women. After the rapes we left the halls. I do not know what happened to those women. 

""We went back to the first roadblock. We were supposed to head to Bab Siba but they changed their mind and we returned to the headquarters of the III Corps.“

FIDH collected testimonies from refugees, supporting organizations, and Syrian human rights activists during an international fact-finding mission in December 2012 that was carried out in cooperation with the Jordan-based nonprofit Arab Women Organization.

In an interview with members of Syria Bright Future in Amman on December 14, 2012, a doctor said that his relative in Homs had been raped. She became pregnant, he said, and when she went to Damascus, hotels refused to let her in because they somehow knew she was a rape survivor. The doctor also reported that she couldn’t find a clinic that would provide an abortion.

The date of the reported rape is unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:24:47.872939,,"{'addressComponents': {'streetAddress': '5', 'adminArea1': 'Syria', 'formattedAddress': '5, Syria'}, 'coords': [36.71817, 34.733879]}",nb8WmRQYRQ2W0pdV-d4Yjg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2012-12-14T22:41:00.000Z,34369-201,ushahidi,Doctor says his relative in Homs was raped and impregnated,"[{'name': '3OF.

2014-05-09 19:28:33.849293,"A Syrian activist in Turkey told WMC’s Women Under Siege about a woman named Duha, 25, from Jableh who was kidnapped around December 14, 2012, by shabiha (plainclothes militia) forces and held for three or four months.

Duha was reportedly visiting her boyfriend, who had asked to marry her, in the Latakia countryside when shabiha stopped her at a roadblock before a town named Salma. A shabiha member reportedly took Duha’s phone and called her boyfriend, identifying himself as a member of the Free Syrian Army. The man told him Duha was with them and asked where he’d like them to drop her off. When the boyfriend asked that they send her on to Salma, the activist said, they replied: “We’re going to send her to hell.”

She was transferred to the Palestine Security Branch in Damascus “because her boyfriend was a member of the FSA,” the activist said. 

“They beat her and tortured her,” he said. “For long period her body had signs of torture.” He described how guards told Duha, “This is the freedom we’re going to give you,” as they sexually “humiliated” her.

Duha’s driver and mother were also detained at the roadblock. Eventually, Duha and her mother were released in a prisoner exchange, according to the activist, but the driver is still in prison.

2014-05-09 19:28:34.625043,"The following video was received via the crowdmap. Filmed sometime within the past three months, the video shows a number of men, almost all of who are civilians, being physically and mentally tortured in a military hospital in Homs. Sexualized violence is among the atrocities allegedly committed by doctors and staff.  

A group named Syria4All disseminated the footage itself and a news segment was aired on the UK’s Channel 4. The clip was posted to YouTube via NoraNews, a network whose coverage focuses on the Syrian revolution and the Arab Spring. 

The video shows a Syrian state facility that has, in the words of the former employee who covertly filmed, become a “torture chamber.” The hospital worker says he tried to end the “shameful” acts but he was discovered. The video states that his interview was conducted in a safe location. 

“I’ve seen detainees being tortured with electrocution, whipping, beaten with batons and by breaking their legs,” he says. “They operate without anesthetics…they shackle the patients to the bed. They deny them water. Others have their penises tied to stop them from urinating.”

He continues: “The youngest I saw was 14 or 15 years old. Many detainees’ names were removed from emergency admissions list, so that no one would know where they were. There were no names, just numbers. One of the doctors put alcohol on the pubic area of a 15-year-old boy, then set him on fire.”

He says that on government orders, all of those wounded in protests in Homs must be brought to the military hospital. The source maintains that there were some doctors there who refused to participate in the torture of patients, but that they were under constant surveillance.  

The Syrian government refused to comment when Channel 4 asked it to respond to the allegations contained in this report, and the exact dates of the reported sexualized violence are unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:24:59.345056,,"{'addressComponents': {'streetAddress': '5', 'adminArea1': 'Syria', 'formattedAddress': '5, Syria'}, 'coords': [36.71817, 34.733879]}",bODQ39prR5ygomGUTZdksg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2012-12-04T23:56:00.000Z,34369-138,ushahidi,Video reveals alleged sexualized torture of civilian men in Homs military hospital,"[{'name': '8-2GF.

But everywhere else, there's a very different story:

Emblematic of the latter problem is the price of chicken, which rose in two weeks from 45,000 rials (£2.37) to the equivalent £3.84 a kilo, astronomical by local standards and prompting some restaurants to remove it from their menus.

2014-05-09 19:28:35.386253,"On April 9, the Paris-based nonprofit International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) released a report that detailed multiple alleged acts of sexualized violence in Syria. FIDH collected testimonies from refugees, supporting organizations, and Syrian human rights activists during an international fact-finding mission in December 2012 that was carried out in cooperation with the Jordan-based nonprofit Arab Women Organization.

Syria Bright Future, a nonprofit association working with Syrian refugees, reported that their doctors and psychologists were treating survivors of sexualized violence. In an interview with FIDH in Amman on December 14, 2012, one of the association’s doctors said he was treating a rape victim whose brother had been forced to rape her by regime security forces.

2014-05-09 19:28:34.533515,"A hospital administrator in southern Turkey told WMC’s Women Under Siege about a 14-year-old girl who was treated at the hospital for rape and torture at the hands of eight shabiha (plainclothes militia) members in Idlib in December 2012.

The girl was held in the basement of a private house for seven or eight days, according to the administrator, who said that signs of sexual assault on the girl were “very clear” and that she had lesions on her vagina. He said men had ejaculated on her and that she was raped; she had cigarette burns on her body and black eyes when she arrived at the hospital. The men, the girl told the hospital, used hot metal rods to burn her arms, legs, and thighs. She also said that she was forced to witness two people executed in front of her.

“She gets very agitated every time she tells her story,” the administrator said, adding that the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria had documented her case previously. 

According to the UN COI report, the girl “was abducted by four men, two of whom were in uniform, and held a building in Idlib by people she described as ‘Shiites from her neighborhood.’ She was interrogated about her mother’s work with the FSA. Her treatment — which included her being raped — is detailed in document A/HRC/22/59, annex IX. She described being beaten, burnt with cigarettes and injected with an unknown substance. In interview, her doctor stated that she had injuries highly consistent with her account.”

The extended UN COI account says: “She was denied food and water for extended periods of time. On the fifth day of her detention, four young men were brought into the room where they raped her. Two days later, she was released. Her father took her to a gynecologist outside Syria. … This 14-year-old girl has tried to commit suicide three times, saying, ‘My life has no value. I lost everything, what has gone will never come back.’” 

Raiefa Sammei, who works in the executive office for the Local Administration Council for the City of Idlib, told WMC’s Women Under Siege that she had spoken with the girl’s mother, who confirmed many of these details, and that the house where the girl was held is a known location used for rape for at least the past seven months. Sammei said there are “at least two to three girls held there at any time.”

The girl was smuggled out of the house by a woman who served the men tea and coffee and took pity on her, Sammei said. She added that the girl was forced to perform oral sex on the men. According to the activist, the girl has had a “breakdown” since leaving the house.

2014-05-09 19:30:02.303620,"Designer - Pamela Berstler with G3/The Green Gardens Group.
Installation - community Hands-On Workshop (HOW), led by G3, and co-sponsored by Aveeno and ELLE Magazine as part of the 2011 Film Independent Spirit Awards. The garden also qualified for funds through the City of Santa Monica's landscape retrofit program.

  This highly visible landscape presents an example of replacing rarely-used turf grass with climate-appropriate gardening for every parent, child, or neighborhood resident who passes by throughout the day. The turf grass used at least 32,000 gallons of water a year. This reduces water use by 35-50%. Local native plants invite birds, butterflies, and people to explore the soft, mulched pathways and smell the fragrant flowers and foliage.  The colors of the blooms match the colors on the mural backdrop: from red, yellow, and white to blue.  
  For every inch of rain, more than 2,500 gallons of water would run off the roof of the adjacent auditorium and flow right into the street or alley, where it would pick up pollutants and speeds to the beach, creating a polluted mess for at least 72 hours after every storm. The new garden has directed the two main downspouts from the roof into the garden, allowing the rain to take a detour through the planting beds and garden paths; slowing down, spreading out, and sinking back into the soil for plants to utilize. We used a rain barrel on one of the downspouts to demonstrate how a person could capture water at their own home and then allow the overflow to go into their landscape. New low-flow drip irrigation controlled by a weather-based irrigation controller was installed to further reduce the amount of water used by the landscape (by approximately 20%). A separate meter for the garden was installed to measure how much water is used.
  The concrete used to mark the pathway has been recycled from a driveway that was demolished recently.  All of the woodchips used in mulching the garden were brought from a local tree trimmer, effectively removing the chips from the waste cycle.  All of the old grass and soil that was excavated making the pathways has been kept on site, eliminating the need to haul away materials.  Sheet mulching was used to remove the existing grass, so no toxic chemicals were required. Fertilizers and pesticides have been eliminated because the garden is being fed with worm castings and compost tea.
  At the end of the HOW, participants were treated to spa treatments, provided by Aveeno at the Miramar Hotel & Bungalows.

2014-05-09 19:28:33.764289,"The United Nations Human Rights Council’s independent commission of inquiry on Syria released a report on February 5 documenting crimes against humanity committed since September 2011. The investigation’s findings include numerous cases of rape, sexualized violence, and sexualized torture. 

Interviewees attested to the sexualized violence committed by shabiha (plainclothes militia) and other pro-government forces during house searches. A young woman (the report does not state her age) from Dara’a described the invasion of her town on November 22, 2012, by shabiha and Syrian security forces. Between 20 and 30 soldiers and shabiha members entered her home looking for the family’s men, who were hiding in the basement, she said. Her aunt, three female cousins, and three sisters-in-laws were all in the house.

The woman described the shabiha members as “Shi’as” from her village whom she recognized by name. She said they began to beat her elderly aunt when she told them the male relatives were in Lebanon. Then one shabiha member “took two of her cousins upstairs to a separate room and locked the door while the others stayed downstairs. After the shabiha left, the two stated that they had been beaten, but she noticed the cousins couldn’t walk properly afterwards and couldn’t explain why they were separated from the rest if they had only been beaten.” 

The report does not state what kind of sexualized violence may have been carried out, if any, in this raid. 

The date of the reported attacks are unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:24:50.200751,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea1': 'Syria', 'formattedAddress': 'Dar‘ā, Syria', 'adminArea5': 'Dar‘ā'}, 'coords': [36.105221, 32.6245]}",kuYObnfVQkSRDVjre4HOLA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2012-11-22T07:18:00.000Z,34369-159,ushahidi,UN: Woman from Dara'a describes possible rape of her cousins,"[{'name': '3SF.

2014-05-09 19:28:35.554215,"The Center for Civil Society and Democracy in Syria, a nonprofit group based in southern Turkey, told WMC’s Women Under Siege about the detainment, rape, and torture of a female activist from Idlib. The activist, 38, was reportedly detained three times at a criminal security center in Aleppo. During her first detainment she was beaten so severely in the abdominal region that part of her stomach had to be removed, the group said. During her third detainment—for eight days in November 2012—she said, she was raped.

She has seen three gynecologists in Aleppo who have provided conflicting information on the condition of her reproductive organs, the group said. The first gynecologist she saw, almost immediately after her third release, told her that her condition was “really bad” and she has “completely lost her virginity.” Two other doctors have since told her that this is not the case.

In addition to the physical fallout, the activist struggles with severe psychological effects and feels “unsafe,” the group said. She said her fiancé broke up with her when she told him what happened to her in detention. The group said she is now working with women who have also been raped. 

The exact date of the reported rape is unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:25:07.291999,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea1': 'Syria', 'formattedAddress': 'Halab (Aleppo), Syria', 'adminArea5': 'Halab (Aleppo)'}, 'coords': [37.159279, 36.215549]}",odYeY6hkT9m_LSKmJCZCow,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2012-11-15T04:52:00.000Z,34369-232,ushahidi,Activist raped during third detainment in Aleppo,"[{'name': '3GF.

2014-05-09 19:28:34.715390,"On November 14, 2012, a Syrian-American community organizer named Sarab Al-Jijakli visited a refugee camp known as “Olive Tree” in Atmeh, in northern Syria’s Idlib province. There he spoke with a Free Syrian Army soldier guarding the camp who told him about the rape of a woman at a checkpoint in the Hama countryside.

Al-Jijakli said the fighter, a former plumber, told him that a family traveling in Reef Hama was stopped by shabiha (plainclothes militia) members at a checkpoint. The fighter did not specify a date, but it was understood that this was a recent incident, Al-Jijakli said.

“As a ‘tax’ to pass, they took the family’s daughter and savagely raped her in front of her helpless father, mother, and teenage brother,” Al-Jijakli wrote on his blog (http://sarabiany.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/rape-in-syria/). The fighter referred to the sister as “bint,” or girl, but did not specify her age.

The brother “snapped” after witnessing his sister violated, Al-Jijakli wrote, and days later, the brother rammed a car filled with explosives into the checkpoint, killing shabiha members. Al-Jijakli told WMC’s Women Under Siege that Syrian state media reported the bombing as a “Salafist terrorist suicide attack.” The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that there was a suicide bombing at a checkpoint in Hama on November 5, 2012, that killed 50 Syrian soldiers (http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/05/world/meast/syria-civil-war). WMC’s Women Under Siege has not been able to determine whether this was the attack the fighter described.

Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",2014-05-04T05:24:57.038205,,"{'addressComponents': {'streetAddress': '5', 'adminArea1': 'Syria', 'formattedAddress': '5, Syria'}, 'coords': [36.71817, 34.733879]}",nbCvbZXNToSzPIEnvGbYaA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2012-11-14T03:47:00.000Z,34369-187,ushahidi,FSA soldier tells Syrian-American of rape at Hama checkpoint,"[{'name': '3SF.

2014-05-09 19:30:57.969693,"Rodon Cape Guards would like to invite you to November’s celebrations and activities. Since the early days of August 2012, one hundred cape guards have cleaned 1.5 km of coastline and collected 400 bags of waste. A lot more needs to be done. We are looking for people and ways to strengthen the initiative for the restoration, protection and promotion of one of the most attractive areas along the Adriatic.

Coming up this November:

Thursday, November 15th, 2012. An eventful fundraising night at Tirana Ekspres. M. Moikom Zeqo, a renown historian will animate a forum about the Cape. We encourage you to actively participate to this event. Blerta Kambo, a young but experienced photographer has donated 30 pieces of her collection to the Cape Guards. Her work will be showcased at Tirana Ekspres on Thursday and her photographs will be sold in an open auction. The money will support the next cleaning action. Elinor Butka will perform with his fife instrument and Ervis Eshja with his scratch console. All for your amusement. You will be kindly asked to by a ticket for the performance at a symbolic price of 200 Lekë, 1.5 Euro. Again, the money will support the next cleaning action. We will go back to the Rodon Cape on November 24th for a one day cleaning action together with high-school students from Tirana.

How to be part of it all?

Participate to Thursday’s events, starting at 19h00, at Tirana Ekspres, Rruga Karl Gega, Ish Magazinat e Trenit, Tiranë. Bring your ideas and support us by investing a little money in concert tickets and auction photographs. Volunteer to cleaning actions. The Cape Guards are looking for people that want to do something to reduce pollution in Albania, restore ecosystems, reduce their pollution print and show the way to a sustainable development of tourism. Be patient, tenacious and take initiatives. Alone, we stand aside and watch watch the situation get worse in a widening abyss of despair. Together, we are strong and committed to restore life where it got poisoned. We would like to remind you that the money you give will not end up in our pockets but will help to cover expenses that are necessary to do the job. Also we would like to increase the number of actions we do and specialize in order to be more effective.

Bassam Ismael al-Hajj Ali, who SANA said belongs to an Aleppo-based rebel group called the Al-Tawhid Brigade, told a reporter that “he took part with the rest of his terrorist group” in crimes of killing, kidnapping, looting and rape. Al-Hajj is identified as an electrician who was born in Al-Raqqa province in 1986. 

There is no explicit mention of the second man, Walid Kanaan, confessing to rape except in the article’s title, but the article relates that in a “similar interview” with a SANA reporter, Kannan said he joined Jabhat al-Nusra, a group linked with Al-Qaeda, and “supported the armed terrorist groups” in the Al-Zabdieh neighborhood of Aleppo, among others.

Naser Mohamad Kier al-Hariri, a prominent tribal sheik from the Horan region in the governorate of Dara’a, publically spoke out against the regime’s practices of suppression in April 2011. Shortly thereafter, he announced his resignation from the People’s Assembly. 

He said he was forced to withdraw his resignation less than a month later, however, when he was arrested with the consent of Brigadier General Asef Shawkat and the former chairman of the assembly, Mahmoud al-Abrash, and told, “You will hear your daughter crying if you do not retract the resignation.” Al-Hariri said he understood this as a threat of rape. 

“It does not need much explanation because everyone knows what is going on in Syria,” he said. “When your daughter is threatened, what can you do?” He and his family have since fled the country.

State officials voiced approval of the work accomplished, which included restoring power to most of Manhattan, while renewing warnings that utilities’ response to the crisis is being closely watched by regulators and lawmakers.
“I want to make sure from a consumer’s point of view the power is back up as quickly as possible and that these companies are doing all that they can do,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said yesterday. “These are utilities that are regulated by the state, and consumers have the right to hold them accountable.”",2014-05-04T04:45:44.108919,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'NJ', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Ocean Co.', 'formattedAddress': 'Jackson Township, NJ', 'adminArea5': 'Jackson Township'}, 'coords': [-74.405661, 40.058324]}",DbrB_-NVQDquRy16JC2FzA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2012-11-04T17:48:00.000Z,15974-996,ushahidi,"Sandy’s Blackouts Fall to 1.9 Million, Half in New Jersey","[{'name': 'Natural Disaster', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Blackouts', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:07:26.147560,United States,NJ,Ocean Co.,Jackson Township,"Jackson Township, NJ",,,"{'adminArea3': 'NJ', 'adminArea1': 'United States', 'adminArea4': 'Ocean Co.', 'formattedAddress': 'Jackson Township, NJ', 'adminArea5': 'Jackson Township'}","[-74.405661, 40.058324]",40.058324,-74.405661,Natural Disaster,Blackouts,,en

The friend said that while at the Sports City in November 2012, he witnessed shabiha (plainclothes militia) forces rape a 26-year-old woman from Aleppo. He said he heard the men repeating statements like: “We will humiliate your women. Let your [husband/brother/etc.] come pick you up off the ground. Not a Sunni will enter Latakia without us doing this to his mother, sister, or wife.”

Al-Jundi said that he has heard that anal rape is the norm at the sports complex, where, he estimates, about 950 women are being held. He said he and his colleagues had arrived at this number using their own observations from having been inside and then comparing those with the numbers of people missing.

Various activists allege that the center is run by Hilal al-Assad, a cousin of Bashar al-Assad.

The exact date of the reported rape is unknown.

The girl was severely traumatized, the doctor said. She was not taking care of herself and cried as she was examined about a month after the attack. It took a number of visits for the girl to tell the doctor she’d been raped. She said it happened when shabiha raided her town; her family fled the house not realizing she was still in bed sleeping. 

“There were many men she can’t even remember how many there were,” the doctor said. In particular, the girl clearly remembers the face of the most violent attacker: “I can never forget what he looks like,” she said.

Of utmost concern to the girl was that she still appear physically to be a virgin, so the doctor tried to refer her to a gynecologist, but the girl has not followed up.

The young man has a spinal cord injury sustained from torture during detention at a Syrian army prison in Homs; he was arrested less than a month after joining the FSA, he said. He now lives in a house with about 12 other young men all with spinal cord injuries, the psychiatrist said.

As he recounted his ordeal, he “cried and cried,” the psychiatrist said. He described how his fiancée, sisters, mother, and female neighbors were all brought to the prison and raped in front of him. The psychiatrist didn’t know how many sisters he had or the total number of women he saw raped. 

The young man told her that male friends detained along with him were all raped, then said, “I don’t want to talk about it.” 

The psychiatrist asked him, “Did they rape you?” He then went completely silent, she said. 

She diagnosed him as suffering from severe depression.

Su’ad, a young women from Homs who had worked to aid the wounded of the Free Syrian Army, fled to Dara’a before reaching Jordan, she told two Brandeis students. She said she had been forced to leave her home after her husband turned her in to the Syrian intelligence service, the Mukhabarat, because she wanted to divorce him. 

Su’ad said Assad’s soldiers raped her but that she could not yet bring herself to further describe the assault. When she is ready, she said, “I would like to go on television and tell the whole world of what I’ve been through.” 

Although she has crossed the Jordanian border, Su’ad said she still lives in constant fear of Assad’s forces. “There’s a Mukhabarat officer in a-Ramtha,” she said. “One day he arrived at the market while I was there and asked around about me—I had to run away and hide.” Since this incident, she said, she has been afraid to travel throughout the city.

2014-05-09 19:28:14.442430,"""Ambient Spatial Intelligence (AmSI) is all about embedding in our everyday, dynamic environment the capability to respond to geospatial queries about the events that are occurring.

Some of the theoretical questions we are actively engaged in include:

- How can we design efficient algorithms that can help monitor changes in spatial regions, like the emergence of “hot spots” in sea temperature around sensitive coral reefs?
- How can we develop real-time systems for detecting meaningful spatial events in large groups of mobile objects, like the emergence of “traffic jams” in peak hour transportation networks, or “crowds” at a sporting event?

Some of the key applications of this work currently being addressed in collaboration with researchers around the world include:

- Emergency management: Understanding the movements of people and assets and their impacts on critical infrastructure during emergency response (Collaboration with the University of Maine, USA, University of Nottingham, UK, and University of Exeter, UK)

The scouts added a contoured stream-bed to capture rain water from the roof and paved surfaces, colorful plants and a brick, permeable walkway.  The emphasis of the plant selection for the garden was to provide color year-round.  Plants were selected for their bloom cycle and duration as well as  adaptability to the environment.  A bird bath was carved into a large rock located adjacent to the stream bed.  The landscaping is watered using a subsurface drip system run by a hose timer.  Planting included full sun, part shade and under California live oak trees.
 The goal of the project was to present an attractive garden using low-water use plants, to promote easy to use irrigation controllers and to demonstrate techniques for water conservation and retention in landscaping. The project was built by volunteers from Boy Scout Troop 503 in Oak View.

The system designed by HC Technologies for INET Counters (one of participants of the company) is a fix mesh with routers and a gateway who coordinate the mesh and all the metering systems. Smart meters are design to work up to 10 years with the same battery and they can be configured by the user (time, information delivery time, date and period, etc). Several meshes can form different universes. The mesh can maintain more than 1000 nodes under the same coordinator supervision. Sensors and nodes are really cheap comparing with the competece.

The two met in early 2013 at the Adra detention center. Hanane said she had been arrested and was being transferred to the Palestine Security Branch when four shabiha (plainclothes militia) members transporting her took her instead to an unidentified house in Tadamon, in southern Damascus. There, Hanane told the activist, the men raped her, hung her by her hands, and electrocuted her for 12 hours before finally delivering her to the Palestine Branch. 

She spent the next four months at the branch, without medical treatment for injuries sustained during her attack. She was subsequently transferred to the Adra detention center for four more months; at Adra, she was still so upset by what had happened that she would often work herself into fits of rage and lose consciousness, according to the activist.

Hanane was released sometime at the beginning of June and consulted a human rights lawyer, the activist said.

Two days later I had a 104 degree fever, five days later I had a Peritonsillar Abscess and ear canals clouded up. Following intensive two weeks of antibiotics, which did little to solve the problem, I have used Chinese herbs and diet to rid myself of the organisms that got inside. 

Following research, it is apparent this marsh is a melting pot or organisms that happily mingle in the still warm waters during the summer months.

""The Act, which will be debated in the legislature this fall, would allow “local bodies” - like municipalities and conservation authorities -to create an action plan called a “geographically focused initiative”. What’s new about this approach is it would allow community groups to use new legal tools to deal with a range of locally-identified and locally-relevant issues, including: improving wetlands, forests, shoreline, coastal areas, sewage treatment, land use planning, monitoring and other issues.""

2014-05-09 19:28:16.428568,"""Many emergency events, especially large scale incidents, cross jurisdictional and geographic boundaries. Often in these circumstances, personnel from different agencies and jurisdictions are brought together into a single command structure. It is important for these people to be able to absorb information quickly. Maps play a vital role in summarising and describing a situation.
 
It is well accepted that map products that use a standard set of symbols that are readily understood by all emergency management personnel at all levels of the incident management framework contribute to increased efficiency and safety.
 
ANZLIC – The Spatial Information Council, in association with the Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping (ICSM) want to encourage consistency in how All-Hazards events are depicted on maps and aim to develop a consistent Australasian All-Hazard symbology set and have it adopted by emergency management agencies across Australia and New Zealand. In the medium term, the symbology set would be further developed to support agencies leading responses to law enforcement and counter terrorism.""",2014-05-04T05:21:21.781554,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'ACT', 'adminArea1': 'Australia', 'adminArea5': 'Griffith', 'streetAddress': '113 Canberra Ave', 'postalCode': '2603', 'formattedAddress': '113 Canberra Ave, Griffith, ACT 2603'}, 'coords': [149.146792, -35.321875]}",BupQhXZ7Sr2Shd0gN-jx5w,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2012-09-29T02:00:00.000Z,27474-1042,ushahidi,Australasian All-Hazards Symbology Project,"[{'name': 'METHODS APPROACHES POLICIES', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Projects', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'ARCHIVES', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Conflict', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Natural or Man-made Disaster', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Response', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:28:16.428568,Australia,ACT,,Griffith,"113 Canberra Ave, Griffith, ACT 2603",2603,113 Canberra Ave,"{'adminArea3': 'ACT', 'adminArea1': 'Australia', 'adminArea5': 'Griffith', 'streetAddress': '113 Canberra Ave', 'postalCode': '2603', 'formattedAddress': '113 Canberra Ave, Griffith, ACT 2603'}","[149.146792, -35.321875]",-35.321875,149.146792,METHODS APPROACHES POLICIES,Projects,ARCHIVES,en

2014-05-09 19:28:37.020675,"A UK Guardian reporter based in Aleppo recounted the risk of divulging loyalties at checkpoints in the city. With Free Syrian Army rebels often wearing military fatigues it can be impossible for citizens to discern whom they are talking to. In one case, a man revealed—to FSA soldiers—that rebel soldiers had allegedly tried to rape his mother.

A rebel fighter had brought the young, “pink-faced” man to the frontlines checkpoint, saying he suspected he had family members working for the regime. The young man mistook the rebels for Syrian military forces due their fatigues.

The man then proceeded to parrot pro-regime and anti-rebel statements while being filmed by one of the officers, until one of them struck him in the head. 

“The terrorist elements are in the school right now,” he told the rebel soldiers. “They number 56. Only 11 of them Syrians, sir, these terrorist elements are committing terrorist activities that are terrifying the innocent citizens. They entered my house took our TV set and tried to rape my mother they go around stealing houses and raping young boys and girls.”

According to Le Monde, a woman the paper calls ""Oum Mohamed,"" 45, and her daughter were arrested on the street on September 21, 2012, and detained at the Mezzeh military airport in Damascus. Her daughter’s cell phone had contained an image of the resistance flag and the photo of a well-known martyr. 

The women were beaten, raped, and held in a crowded cell measuring 4 square meters (13 square feet) with 17 other women and children for 20 days, the newspaper reported. 

“Everything was seen as an opportunity for sexual abuse,"" Oum Mohamed said.

Le Monde reports that one woman, the wife of a member of the Free Syrian Army ""suspected of having been part of the kidnapping of 48 Iranians in a bus in August 2012,"" was in the cell along with her children, aged 8 and 9. 

""The husband of another, a prison director who was punished for opposing outrageous torture, was held one floor below, in such a way that he could hear the cries of his wife while she was raped,"" according to the newspaper.

Since their release, the daughter has lost a significant amount of weight and Oum Mohamed fears for her daughter’s future.

In their video, children outline the key factors which are making their community vulnerable to floods, including: illegal logging, slash-and-burn farming practices and sand quarrying. They are also aware that their community is vulnerable due to its location on a valley next to a river. They challenged their local authorities to address these harmful practices and succeeded in mobilising their community in a tree planting campaign.

2014-05-09 19:30:03.231863,"Nearly 30 volunteers put their knowledge and muscle to work installing the first Ocean Friendly Garden project by the Portland/OR Surfrider Chapter on September 16. Pete Stauffer, Surfrider Foundation's National Ocean Program Manager, offered up his home landscaping for the project, creating both an opportunity for volunteers to learn and for Pete to walk his talk.

The workday was led by professional landscape designer, Hannah Snyder of Rain City Gardens. Two months prior, Hannah led volunteers through the design development process, going through four steps: (1) observe and map the site; (2) determine the location of the rain gardens; (3) assess the soil for percolation and soil-type tests; (4) determine the size of the rain gardenCheck out Hannah's cool blogpost about the day's activities.

Hannah lead off the day but running through the design. After volunteers dug out the swale (in the front yard...and they OFG'd the back yard, too), volunteer/Surfrider Oregon Field Coordinator, Charlie Plybon, fitted on an extension to the rain gutter downspout to direct rainwater into the swale (pictured on thumbnail photo to this blog post). Hannah then led the group through plant placement and installation, spacing the plants for mature growth and helping to prevent crowding and the pruning that goes with it (aka green waste).

Prior to the workday, participants had gotten a good education about the ""why"" and ""how"" of landscape changes by attending an in-class presentation (thanks to Multonomah Soil and Water Conservation District). Check out the blog post about the class and workshop.

The Chapter will be able to return to the site for Lawn Patrols (neighborhood walks). Check out the OFG Activist Toolkit to learn more details about OFG activities and how to put them on.

This was a great step forward for the Chapter's OFG Program and the vision that other projects will be coming. Anyone wanting to volunteer their yard for a beautiful OFG retrofit can contact Pete.

At the workday, there was also discussion about how OFG can compliment the Chapter's work on stenciling the storm drains to discourage people from dumping pollutants down them. During winter months, the stenciling program takes a break, and so it's a good time to do other things - like clean out the inlets to curb cuts so rainwater can flow in. The City lacks the resources to do this kind of maintenance and it would be welcomed.

The space was mostly uncultivated with the exception of a wonderful fig tree, olive tree and canary island date palm and some old junipers. We contoured the steep slopes, creating swales for water retention and added forty cubic yards of spent organic mushroom compost. Permeable paving was used throughout the property in the form of crushed gravel walkways and small flagstone patios with dymondia margaretea or decomposed granite in the joints. A meadow-like planting of carex praegracilis was used as a lawn substitute providing seasonal interest as lupines and poppies add color to the scene in spring and summer.

2014-05-09 19:07:26.888665,"Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, wrote last week in The Telegraph, Saudi oil well dries up. He presented the following chart of projected Saudi oil consumption, vertical bars, and production, dark blue line.

By these estimates, in 2022, Saudi Arabia will no longer be supplying oil into global demand but will be competing in global demand for foreign oil. Long before we reach the trade-off point, however, certain exigencies will emerge.

First consider the area on the chart between the two curves. This area is highly correlated to their balance of trade and their foreign exchange reserve acquisition. The website Suite 101 states that [t]he petroleum sector accounts for more than 90% of the Middle Eastern country’s exports. If the two curves are at all representational of what is to come, then it should be noted that they are exponential. The implication is the positive Saudi economic position is decreasing exponentially, doubly so between two diverging exponential trend lines.

2014-05-09 19:28:36.671850,"A woman in her 30s was held at a private house in Idlib for a about a month in September 2012 and then taken to a rural Damascus house in Al-Ghouta and held for seven months, according to Raiefa Sammei, who told WMC’s Women Under Siege about the case. Sammei, who works in the executive office of the Local Administration Council for the City of Idlib, said she learned about the woman’s story from the woman’s cousin’s husband and other sources. 

Twenty women had been held in a single room in the rundown Damascus house, according to Sammei, who said the women were harassed and raped on a daily basis by “many officers.” 

“There were sadistic tendencies,” Sammei said. “They burned them with cigarettes.” Food consisted of vegetables the guards threw at the women, she said.

There were also reportedly pregnancies at the house but Sammei did not have further details.

Sammei said she was told that the woman’s mother paid a million lira ransom for the woman’s release sometime in mid-May. When her brother arrived to pick the woman up at the house, “she was having a nervous breakdown,” and her body was covered in cigarette burns and lice or crabs. On the way back to Idlib, the brother and sister were allegedly stopped at a checkpoint and the brother was arrested; the woman was allowed to enter Idlib and the brother has not been heard from since. 

When the woman arrived at her house in Idlib, Sammei said, her husband wouldn’t let her enter. He reportedly said that since all these men had been “in and out of you, you’re no longer fit to be the mother of my children.” He allegedly said of her three children, “You will forget them.”

The woman is now living at her parents’ house in Idlib but her father tells her every now and then, “I wish you had died and hadn’t come back,” according to Sammei.

(See https://womenundersiegesyria.crowdmap.com/reports/view/212 for another report involving the same private house in Idlib.)

2014-05-09 19:28:36.934682,"The United Nations Human Rights Council’s independent commission of inquiry on Syria released a report on February 5 documenting crimes against humanity committed since September 2011. The investigation’s findings include numerous cases of rape, sexualized violence, and sexualized torture.

According to the UN report, government security forces and shabiha—plainclothes militia—searched a neighborhood in Homs in September 2012. A resident from the area described their rape of his aunt, as well as other women in the area.

The security forces, he explained, went from house to house to detain men, and said that when soldiers could not find men in a given house, they claimed that they were off fighting with the Free Syrian Army. He said that shabiha members also captured between 40 and 50 women from different streets and took them to a wedding hall in the town. His aunt, he said, had been one of those captured. 

Once detained, the interviewee said, the women were raped. Some were detained for hours, others for a few days, and one woman for up to 12 days. Daughters were reportedly raped in front of their mothers. The interviewee said that he would not divulge names so as not to “shame” the women who were attacked, but that he knew some of them.

Report

The First Plastic Collection Camp at Rodoni Cape from August 24 to 26 was our first step as a group. We laid the foundations of a community that needs to grow in order to survive.

What we learned together is that the problems we face are deeply rooted into the Albanian culture. We need to challenge public apathy and institutional confusion, and along the way clea
n up as many beaches and river banks as we can.

The First Plastic Collection Camp at Rodoni Cape succeeded in collecting and safely transporting to a recycling company two truckloads of more than 1,200 kg.

40 individuals were present on site, but the greater network which helped make this project real is much larger, and we believe we have just began to realize how great the human potential really is.

We learned that by pulling resources together, by creating a common fund of 1,000 USD we are able to clean up 2 km of beach, or over 1 ton of plastic.

We also learned that what we got started to do is simply a scratch on the polluted surface of Rodoni Cape. This site of tremendous natural and historic importance is located few miles south of the most polluted watershed of the most polluted river in the whole of the country, the Ishem river.

We found immense quantities of pulverized Styrofoam, the number one packaging and insulation material.

We found large quantities of medical supplies and syringes.

We found oily gore lying along the beach, we found all sorts of visible-to-the-eye pollutants.

We learned that we need to go back as soon as possible, and right now we are looking into ideas of how to get more support.",2014-05-04T05:52:32.402962,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'Durres', 'adminArea1': 'Albania', 'adminArea4': 'Durres', 'formattedAddress': 'Ishëm, Durres, Albania', 'adminArea5': 'Ishëm'}, 'coords': [19.447302, 41.586406]}",NWJmcGfaRYGyXAmgCAP1cg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2012-08-29T01:11:00.000Z,40924-90,ushahidi,RODONI CAPE GUARDS.

2014-05-09 19:28:36.762116,"Darayya-based online opposition newspaper Enab Baladi published an account on November 4, of beatings and threats of rape allegedly perpetrated in late August 2012 by Syrian security forces in the town of Darayya. 

A survivor, Hana, told her story: “We were 10 women. After they took the men outside, they took us one at a time into a room to interrogate us. The interrogator did not ask me any questions about weapons. He just asked me to take off my clothes. I refused and he got mad and slapped me. He called for me again and said that I was the prettiest and the most despicable. When he threatened to kill my husband and son if I did not take my clothes off, I pretended to be sick and claimed that I had just gotten surgery. He cursed me and beat me up.” 

Her sister was similarly threatened and assaulted, she said.

“He asked me about weapons and threatened to rape if me if I did not show them where they were,” she said. “When I kept denying that we had any, he got mad and hit me, saying that he hadn’t been with his wife for months and that it was our fault. When he threatened to kill my brothers, I said that for them to die for their honor is better than them living in humiliation.” 

Usayma, the youngest sister, said she heard the members of the army whispering, “The young one is pretty. Keep her for the officer.” When she refused to undress, they hit and cursed her, saying she must satisfy the young officer. She pleaded with him, saying, “Please, I am like your sister.” They struck her again in response, yelling, “How dare you say that?” 

The women were ultimately spared when orders came to the army members to leave. They were threatened by the officers not to tell anyone what had happened.

The account states that the woman and her cousin had been visiting Darayya, where the following assault occurred: 

“She was dressed in modern clothes and arguing with military officers to give her money and jewelry back,” the witness said. “She went with one into a building and came out after half an hour crying, her clothes torn, and begged one of the officers not to let them take her in again. He replied that he considered her like one of his children. When another officer grabbed her by her hair she screamed, ‘They raped me,’ and the first officer slapped her. Her cousin came to her rescue and, calling him names, they held him back. Then they took him away and nobody saw him after that.”

Shero told NOW Lebanon that Meshaal was transferred to Adra Prison on the outskirts of Damascus and that the judge released him only after Shero paid a bribe.

Both men were activists working with the monastery of Saint Moses the Abyssinian, a monastic community of Syrian Catholics north of Damascus, he said. Shero told NOW Lebanon that he is half Kurdish, half Christian, and that his friend, Meshaal, is Kurdish.

Shero said he was detained and sexually assaulted by Syrian security forces: “The same night [as Meshaal], I was transferred to the crime department,” he said. “At the entrance I saw a half-naked woman crying. As I was being interrogated, one officer came in and raped me, then another, then a third. The three raped me as the colonel and his assistant laughed. I was screaming, and no one came to my aid. I lost consciousness at a point, and then woke up to their kicking. One asked the other if I had died or not. The police there tried to harass me too. I managed to get some outside help, and so I was released and so was Meshaal.”

Details of what Shero said happened to Meshaal can be found here: http://syria.womenundersiegeproject.org/reports/view/101.

Additionally, Shero said he knows of two women who were raped but who “would not consider speaking up.” One of the women, he said, was raped because “she was a Christian protesting the regime.”

“Security forces very often resort to sexual violence to terrorize the people, even before the uprising,” Shero said. “However, today the public is hearing more of it because of the media attention. There have been many cases of rape during the uprising, but people are afraid to speak up.”
The dates of the reported rapes are unknown.

2014-05-09 19:28:37.453332,"The United Arab Emirates-based news channel Al-Arabiya published an August 16 testimony of a young Syrian girl in which she relates the circumstances of her gang-rape and mass killings by the forces of the Assad regime at an unknown location.

“We were all tied up in the town main square,” the girl said. “The children were terrified and crying. The men were taken away. We were afraid and asking for mercy. I was shaking. There were 30 of them with firearms and knives. Their eyes were scary.

“They took the older women and children away and kept us, the younger women, in the square. They started with me. One of them untied me. When I resisted he pulled my hair and pushed me to the ground. I hit my head. When I screamed, my mother recognized my voice. I heard her saying, ‘Please leave her, she is so young. Take me instead, I beg you.’ They just laughed.

“Three faces got close to mine, and many hands started touching my body. Within seconds I was naked. I tried to fight back. I was trembling like a slaughtered hen. Their arms were like octopus arms squeezing me. I eventually stopped moving. I felt paralyzed. I felt like I was suffocating. They smelled rotten, like death. They shouted, ‘You want freedom? This is freedom, freedom, freedom.’ One monster hit me on the face and kicked my body. He stepped on my chest and I heard my bones cracking. Pain felt like a fire whipping me. I heard them cursing my screaming mom, ‘Shut up, you… .’

“Ten beasts took turns raping me. When I looked around I saw my mom dead on the ground, covered with blood with all the rest. They killed them, even the children. They tortured and killed the other girls, too.”

“One of them wanted to cut my neck, but his friend said, ‘She is dying anyway. Look how she is breathing.’ I was barely taking any breaths. Most of my ribs were broken. They dragged me and threw me in a garbage container.”

Al-Arabiya reports that the girl is currently living outside of Syria in a hostel with other girls who have suffered rape and assault. The girl told Al-Arabiya that that although she knows that there are support services where she is, they do not serve to reduce the weight of the trauma she faced. 

""I feel scared, I feel that I will lose my mind one day,"" she said. ""There are bouts of anger where I shout, 'Where am I now? Where are you, Dad? Where are you, Mom? My brothers? My family.'""

“Some of my friends who refused to rape were shot,” Mohamed said. “I managed to disobey, and fortunately, the officers got distracted,” he adds.

“The officers were mostly Alawite, and they would target the houses of [opposition] activists in Homs and gather the younger girls and rape them,” Mohamed said. “After they’d finished they’d tell the soldiers outside to come in and rape the girls, too. The girls would generally be shot when everyone had finished. They wanted it to be known in the neighborhoods that the girls had been raped, but they didn’t want the girls to survive and be able to identify them later.”

The Korea Power Exchange, the state-run distributor of electricity, was forced to issue a power shortage warning twice this week as its electricity reserve dropped to below 3 million kilowatts, less than 4 percent of the country's total supply.

The spike in consumption results, of course, directly from high mid-day temperatures that have stayed well above 35 degrees Celsius since late last month, the market watchers said. The capital Seoul is also under a record 13-day streak of tropical nights where overnight temperatures remain above 25 C.

2014-05-09 19:28:36.582376,"We received the following report on October 8 to the crowdmap. A follow-up conversation with Khalilah Sabra, who signed the report, revealed that she and three other women accompanied a group of women and girls across the Syrian border into Jordan on or around August 4. Sabra is part of the U.S.-based MAS (Muslim American Society) Immigrant Justice Center, which has filed more than 200 applications for humanitarian visas for victims of the war in Syria, she said.

“We were fortunate to assist 23 women and young girls across the Syrian border. Most of these females had been beaten and raped. Age was not a factor. The eldest was over 50 and the youngest was only 8 years old. 

“There was still blood on her legs. She was found and brought to the border before having the opportunity of changing her torn clothes or washing the blood from the bottom portion of her body. It was impossible to not notice that she was still in pain and that her injuries remained raw. I asked her would she like a sheet. I changed my seat in the van we road in on our way to Jordan and placed the white sheet across the little girl. I tried to hold back my tears as the sheet became stained from the blood dripping down her small legs. I not only saw her pain but I could see her sadness was heavier than any fear she might have.” 

Sabra told WMC’s Women Under Siege that a doctor’s exam confirmed that the girl had been raped, and that the perpetrator, according to the women who accompanied the girl, was a shabiha (plainclothes militia) member. The attack allegedly occurred somewhere near Al Suwayda, in southern Syria, in the month of Ramadan, which was from July 20 to August 18, 2012.

“Although she survived, in my own emotional distress, I wondered if it would have been better for this small defenseless girl if she had not lived. What does a world hold for a hopeless human being that has lost everything, including the rights over her own body. This life cannot possibly give her more than it has taken. This obvious display in inhumanity does not make living worthwhile. She will be destined to live in a world in which her mother and sisters did not survive the assault of their attackers.  I kept thinking, is there a point to this kind of survival?”

2014-05-09 19:28:38.490306,"The Assistance Coordination Unit, a Turkey-based group documenting human rights abuses, documented the rape and torture of a 12-year-old boy from Douma, a Damascus suburb. The young boy was with his father on a cattle farm when regime forces detained them both. They were taken to the Air Force Intelligence base in Mezzeh (Damascus), according to the ACU, which interviewed the boy. The youth was detained for six months and was released February 2012; the father is still being held. 

According to ACU’s documentation, the young boy was raped and tortured sexually. One form of torture involved hanging bags of water from his testicles, he said. Torture marks were visible, including cigarette burns on his arms and body, the ACU reported. The young boy stated that he was also used as a slave to cook, clean floors, and distribute food to other prisoners, including female prisoners. He reported that other children were also used as slaves.
 
Originally, the youth was held in a solitary confinement cell with another child. He was then moved to another cell with other children who were also used as slaves. Other cellmates included two 16-year-old boys from Douma, who were alleged to be fighters in a particular Free Syrian Army brigade. The 12-year-boy was also accused of being a leader of the brigade. None of the boys were part of any brigade, ACU said; additionally, the particular brigade did not even exist at the time of their detention, the group said. It is unclear whether the two 16-year-old boys were raped or sexually abused during their detention.

The 12-year-old boy, in addition to having physical scars, suffers from post-traumatic stress and psychological issues, ACU said. He refuses to see a psychiatrist despite offers of help.

2014-05-09 19:28:38.665970,"The United Nations Human Rights Council’s independent commission of inquiry on Syria released a report on February 5 documenting crimes against humanity committed since September 2011. The investigation’s findings include numerous cases of rape, sexualized violence, and sexualized torture. 

One woman interviewed said she believed a thousand women had been raped during an attack by Syrian security forces in Al-Hrak, in Dara’a governorate, in August 2012. 

“The commission has come across many reports at second-hand that suggest that sexual violence has become routinized in operations by the security forces,” the report states.
No further facts on this alleged mass rape were provided, but the same interviewee revealed to the commission details on the local treatment of female survivors. She said that community leaders will ask a young man to marry unmarried survivors of rape, “if he is willing to protect her.” The report notes that here she used the Arabic phrase “yustur ‘alayha,” which the report says “connotes protecting, covering, and condoning.” 

Other interviewees from Homs and Dara’a echoed this woman’s account, saying that several unmarried victims were married off to Free Syrian Army fighters. The commission’s report stresses that “such marriages may skirt important questions of consent and run the risk of re-victimizing the women and girls concerned.”

2014-05-09 19:28:38.222605,"On April 9, the Paris-based nonprofit International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) released a report that detailed multiple alleged acts of sexualized violence in Syria. FIDH collected testimonies from refugees, supporting organizations, and Syrian human rights activists during an international fact-finding mission in December 2012 that was carried out in cooperation with the Jordan-based nonprofit Arab Women Organization.

In an interview with FIDH in Cairo on November 1, 2012, a Syrian woman told FIDH about her experience after being detained by shabiha (plainclothes militia) forces at a checkpoint in August 2012.

The woman said she was on her way to work one morning when she was stopped at a security checkpoint in Harasta, a suburb in the northeastern district of Damascus. She described being forced out of the bus after security asked for her identification and into a parked vehicle near the checkpoint. The car already had two girls in it, she said, and a soldier took away her cell phone, blindfolded, and handcuffed her. 

“I was very afraid that they were going to rape me,” she said. “One of the girls was crying.” 

The woman said she was able to tell that they had left Damascus after being in the car for more than an hour. They were taken into a studio that served as shabiha headquarters and were told that they would not be taken to a security/intelligence branch, she said. The woman described how her fear of rape escalated when one of her abductors told her he liked her. The abductees were questioned in separate rooms, and one girl was released after the shabiha found evidence of her being pro-regime on her phone, the woman said.

When she was led alone to her interrogation room, the woman asked instead to be questioned in front of everyone else, she told FIDH. The abductor who had told her he liked her hit and forced her to enter the small room, she said. She denied his allegations that she was active in the revolution and that a friend had confessed to her activity. 

“He then began to touch me, putting his hands on my lips and playing with them,” she said.

After spending five hours in the studio, the abductees were taken to a small house where two men informed them that they were being held in ransom for two abductees the residents of Harasta had captured. 

Three young men and one elderly man came to the house at night, the woman said. They bound her hands and feet, gagged her, and placed on the floor. Soon, two of the men started to touch her all over her body, including her sensitive parts. 

“A short time later, two of them began to approach me, touching me all over my body and on my sensitive parts,” she said. “They started drinking and again came over to me every so often, but they did not rape me.”

2014-05-09 19:28:38.577643,"A July 14 story in The Telegraph (UK) included confessions of rape and murder from an Assad supporter, as well as the claim that he received a salary of 30,000 Syrian pounds (US$466) each month to act indiscriminately, with a 10,000-pound (US$155) bonus for each person that he captured or killed. He said the government supplied him with his weapon and that he was exempt from Syrian law.

“We love Assad because the government gave us all the power--if I wanted to take something, kill a person or rape a girl I could,” he told The Telegraph.

Speaking at a secret rebel detention center in the Idlib Province in northern Syria that was previously used as a hideout for opposition forces, the shabiha member, originally from Orem al Kubra, admitted in specific detail to one rape, while adding that his commander raped many times. This behavior is “normal,” he said. He went on to describe the rape he committed.

He and his commanding officer were driving through Aleppo, a commercial hub in northern Syria, when a girl passed them in the street, he said. He described how they abducted her and drove to an abandoned home where they both raped her. Following the rape, they murdered her to prevent her from identifying them, the shabiha fighter said.

""She was a student of Aleppo University,” he said. “It was daytime and I was driving around the city with my boss. She was passing on the street. I said to my boss, 'What do you think about this girl? Is she not beautiful?' 

""We grabbed her and put her into the car. We drove to an abandoned home and we both raped her. After we finished we killed her. She knew our faces and our neighbors, so she could not live.""

The Silicon Cape vision is of an ecosystem in the Western Cape of South Africa, that serves to attract and bring together local and foreign investors, the brightest technical talent, and the most promising entrepreneurs, to foster the creation and growth of world-class global IP start-up companies in an environment that competes with other similar hubs around the world against the backdrop of one of the most beautiful settings and pleasant places to live, work and play on the globe.

The concept of the Silicon Cape is not owned or controlled by any single entity. It is a living community and an organic, ever-developing concept in the hearts and minds of every participant, which endeavours to catalyse the local IP entrepreneurial community.

The initiative aims firstly to start a conversation -- to plant a seed and foster the concept of the Silicon Cape in people’s minds and on their lips around the world as the emerging Silicon Valley of Africa, and to assist in the creation of an environment and a perception of the area as a world-class location and destination that is not only capable of delivering but already is.

After this transport, SANA reported, Bakkour “and his cohorts were offered money to bear arms, and they accepted and received a rifle, a backpack, four magazine[s], and two grenades each. They started by attacking an intelligence detachment and setting up a roadblock in Al-Qseir.” The news agency does not clarify this information further.

My first streamed audio interview on SoundCloud -- a new way to share ideas (first link below).

I was biking by Quinte Conservation and almost didn't stop thinking ""no one is going to talk to me"". But I'm glad I did. The staff found Lucille Fragomeni - the Source Water Protection Communications Coordinator - on the phone for me and we did a 14 minute audio interview about her work.

The rest of the links follow our conversation about:

- the current review of drinking water in Ontario and this local watershed (comments due before August 20th, 2012)
- water quality threats from fuel storage and septic systems
- public education with projects like the Stream of Dreams
- the pollution and perception issues of bottled water

Lucille was a spring of information and the Quite Conservation website is rich for one's water literacy including a series of maps to help people see water quality issues. 

Before I left staff loaded me up with resources on:
- Bay of Quinte Remedial Action Plan
- many info sheets on local water quality policies and developments
- info sheets on their Stream of Dreams, Yellow Fish Road, Watershed Watch, and Water Monitoring programs.

Conservation Authorities take the proper approach of watershed planning and education in my opinion.

I still have a lot to learn about how our conventional detergents, pharmaceuticals, road run-off, pesticides, and everyday chemicals combine and effect water quality and how we can not just manage risk but eliminate the sources.

2014-05-09 19:29:27.693904,"We stayed on a farm for 2 nights and talked to some organic farmers weeding carrots on a super hot morning.

The link below is the 14 minute conversation I had with a young farmer who is trying to run an organic farm. He was also weeding the carrot bed while talking - illustrating his dedication not to use pesticides AND to voice his opinions about why water matters.

We talked about paradigm shifts, living by example, cheap food, labour value, and seeing trees and soil as part of a water sustainability.

A big theme was the conflict between 'private' property rights and the 'commons' rights that are needed to protect the water that flows from his neighbour's land, to his land, to Fish Lake, to the Bay of Quinte, and ultimately into Lake Ontario.

Farmers are stewards of the land, but the values and practices of this stewardship are often fields apart.

One image above is of a water cistern that collected about 800 liters of water during a 20 minute rain storm from a modest sized garage. I was amazed by this flow, which was then recycled into the carrot bed we were kneeling in.

So a Water Commons also needs to sync with sustainable and organic farming - just another layer in this fertile project.

Do you think about how your food choices influence water quality and quantity? What can be done differently and where do sustainability and stewardship meet? Lastly, what could 'commons' property rights include?",2014-05-04T05:34:41.860534,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Prince Edward', 'adminArea5': 'Prince Edward', 'streetAddress': '1034 Fish Lake Rd', 'postalCode': 'K0K', 'formattedAddress': '1034 Fish Lake Rd, Prince Edward, ON K0K, Canada'}, 'coords': [-77.1585, 44.105986]}",h06HHnrbRZGzqK77Sa5NUw,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2012-07-04T13:28:00.000Z,36776-66,ushahidi,Farming Perspectives on the Water Commons,"[{'name': 'Stories & Places', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:29:27.693904,Canada,ON,Prince Edward,Prince Edward,"1034 Fish Lake Rd, Prince Edward, ON K0K, Canada",K0K,1034 Fish Lake Rd,"{'adminArea3': 'ON', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Prince Edward', 'adminArea5': 'Prince Edward', 'streetAddress': '1034 Fish Lake Rd', 'postalCode': 'K0K', 'formattedAddress': '1034 Fish Lake Rd, Prince Edward, ON K0K, Canada'}","[-77.1585, 44.105986]",44.105986,-77.1585,Stories & Places,,,en

In Bloomfield, Prince Edward County we talked with Rick while getting our bikes checked out and riding a tandem bike (for the first time!). Bloomfield Cycles is a wicked bike shop.

Rick had some great critiques on how much we waste water and how our water treatment infrastructure is an engineering dinosaur, while ignorant of biology and watersheds.

The top video above is the audio of our conversation with some (mostly random) photos of our bike tour around lake Ontario so far.

The other videos follow up on Rick's knowledge of Biolytix and water management. 

On a personal note, I was in Whitby today during a hard rain storm. While the area (Greater Toronto) has had 50% of the rain we normally have this summer, I couldn't help think about the waste I saw while in the car. Most of this brief and heavy rain would soon be in sewers and local streams and en route to lake Ontario. Nothing for the flowers, trees, and food in the ground. Because most surfaces in suburban areas are hard (roofs, driveways, roads, parking lots) this water is not returned into the soil. Capturing this water is simple: rain barrels, wetlands, green roofs, and gravel. 

Maybe one day we won't be watering our lawns, cleaning our cars, or even flushing our toilets with treated drinking water. 

What are some others ways to save and treat water? Or even reduce how much we use and eliminate the pollutants all together? Wow, let it rain!

According to the report, a man named Fawzi was ""detained for the second time on August 6 and spent about 70 days in detention, including about 40 days in Branch 291"" in Damascus. He told HRW he was tortured and that detention officers threatened to rape his family members:

""After the first week they took me for questioning,” he said. “They read to me what they said I had confessed to while in the Military Intelligence branch in Aleppo. But the information was completely different [from what I told the interrogators there]. It said that I had confessed to carrying weapons, that I was part of gangs, that we communicated with other gangs and so on. I denied everything for three hours. Then they placed me facing a wall with my hands cuffed behind my back for seven or eight hours.

“The next day the interrogation continued. They started threatening me and my family. They said that if I don’t confess they would bring in my mother and siblings and rape and abuse them. He was going through my phone, asking about names.

“They beat me with batons and electric cables before they again made me stand for three, four hours before they brought me back to the cell. The same routine took place three, four days in a row.

“We could hear people from other cells being tortured, including women who were screaming when they slapped them.

“Some people were held standing against the wall deprived of sleep for up to seven days. They would just lose it and started confessing to everything without even being asked.""

Halim, 31, was detained on August 8, 2011, in Dara'a governorate, according to the report. He said he was transferred to Branch 291 in Damascus and detained there for 20 days.

""They took five of us out to the corridor,"" he told HRW. ""Four were waiting while the fifth was being interrogated. We were standing up, blindfolded, and handcuffed. They beat me. An officer placed a gun to my head, he gave me electric shocks with a stun-gun, and he made me sit on a stick in the ground [sexually abusing me]. There were no real questions— just accusations. But I denied everything.""

The government has asked households and businesses served by six utilities in central and western Japan to voluntarily cut consumption of electricity by between five and 15 percent on summer 2010 levels through to September 7.

Power consumption usually rises in the summer as people turn on air conditioners to cope with the sometimes sweltering weather.

Our last night on the USA side of Lake Ontario was at Westcott Beach State Park. Before we left we talked to 3 young men about their connections to the lake.

It was just a coincidence that we watched these same youths playing in the water the night before during a beautiful sunset as they were flinging sand/mud at each other. Looked like real fun.

We started with naming the Great Lakes. Could they name all 5? We gave them the H.O.M.E.S. mnemonic device -- each letter marking the letter of one of the lakes. Ontario and Erie were easy and the youngest got Superior. Huron and Michigan were forgotten, but it was fun playing our little guessing game.

They swim, fish, jet ski, and boat on the water and they think it's
pretty safe to be in. They said they eat the large fish they catch,
but didn't really know what is in the water. This has been a common theme when talking to folks. While people differ on how the rate the water quality, they generally feel under informed and curious about what's in the water and how standards and testing are governed.

The linked video for the Waterlife documentary is a great resource on this topic if anyone is interested.

The other link is for fish eating regulations.

What do you think is in the water? Does your location have 'special ingredients'?

Production alternated between Hadsund, Denmark and Nordhausen, Germany. During the first five generations over 1000 electric vehicles were produced. The vehicle was sold in eighteen countries. In 1998 all rights were acquired by ElBil Norge AS (which at the time was called Kollega Bil AS). Bil is the Norwegian word for car (as in automobile), Norge is the Norwegian word for Norway. For some years ElBil Norge further developed the electric vehicle and in the autumn of 2005 a new model was presented that was first called Kewet Buddy Citi-Jet 6, but is now known simply as the Buddy.

In December 2008, the first 12 Buddy cars were sent from the Buddy factory in Økern by boat to Copenhagen.[2] In 2010, Pure Mobility (former ""Elbil Norge"") launched a brand new version of the Buddy.

Spanning several generations of sailors, this community welcomed us with so much curiosity and generosity it was a bit overwhelming.

They shared a deep connection with these waters and I hope they add their voices to this collaborative map.

After stopping to pick our own cherries, we wondered into Singer Farm Naturals and Kayla started up a conversation with Vivian, one of the owners. The barn was recently renovated into a cozy lounge, café, store, and learning space. Vivian ended up sitting us down with their special tart Cherry Fizz and telling us about all the happenings of
the area.

2 topics of particular interest to us were the talks on changing the lake levels and local fracking. Both had info by the bathrooms for all to see.

The International Joint Commission governs the water levels of the Great Lakes and wants to start matching their flow with ecological needs and seasonal fluctuations. Many might not know that the lakes have been managed to make the levels more uniform over the past several decades, so change is hard to agree on. This issue is divisive because many folks and communities have their properties so close to the current lake level, that any increase would be destructive.

However, the proposed changes would not only increase more habitat for a variety of plant and animal species, it could even benefit some communities closer to the St. Lawrence. What do you think we should do about the levels?

The second big water issue in this region was Fracking (using water and chemicals to explode rock far underground in order to capture natural gas). Local Governor Cuomo is advancing plans for Fracking in this area even with a lot of opposition. The government’s approach seems flawed to me –  instead of reaching a consensus of the region
(or watershed) about the potential risks and gains, they have chosen to manage risk on a community-by-community basis.  As if water risks are contained only to the communities that want to take them. 

What’s your perspective about Fracking and what’s happening where you live?

So thank you Vivian and Joe for Singer Farm Naturals and giving the public a place to sit, drink, and think. This farm/business also sported a new solar panel and wind turbine, further showing their commitment to new ways of doing things.

Riding from Hamilton to Beamsville, we went through Grimsby and Port Dalhousie. We spoke with Cindy who was very concerned about all the housing development in the area. We saw this first hand since the Waterfront Trail we were biking on was largely tracking through new subdivisions.
 
Cindy believes water is part of our Canadian culture and that some limits are needed with the pollution caused by motorboats and we are squandering our children's heritage just taking from nature what we want and not being good stewards.

One example of the housing changes was a new condo building going up in Port Dalhousie that could change the feel of the place and access to the parks and waters. She felt there needs to be more parks along the water, but that money talked louder than protest petitions.

Our next water talker was Ted. Riding his bike regularly in the area, he shares this thoughts in the video below about water stewardship (thanks again for the fruit and map Ted).

2 personal stories today about the Burlington lake shore. I wish they were more optimistic, but I appreciate the honesty. 

Today I was reflecting on how water is used - what role it plays in our lives. 

Along my bike tour from Oakville to Hamilton I saw multi-million dollar mansions (water as prime real estate), I saw water with sludge in it (water as a sewer), I saw manufactured water play parks (water as entertainment), and I saw lonely beaches with no one on them (water as ignored).

So we value water when it increases the price of our homes, but then let it get treated as a sewer. We come down to the water to play, enjoy the view, boat, and rest, but we ignore the lake and instead manufacture fake waterfalls, ponds, and chlorinated plash parks. 

I saw almost 100 people being paid to set up a weekend music festival by the water. How many people would it take to clean the lake so that people can swim and fish in it? Now that would be music to my ears.

Their mission? They want to turn the smart city into a searchable media information database. Here is how they describe it:

The Future Internet will include a large number of internet-connected sensors (including cameras and microphone arrays), which provide opportunities for searching and analyzing large amounts of multimedia data from the physical world, while also integrating them into added-value applications. Despite the emergence of techniques for searching physical world multimedia (including the proliferation of participatory sensing applications), existing multimedia search solutions do not provide effective search over arbitrary large and diverse sources of multimedia data derived from the physical world.

In other words, like the early Internet days there is an almost infinite amount of new data out there but how do users organize it?  

Enter SMART, a Search engine for MultimediA environment geneRated contenT. 

Dr Iadh Ounis, of the University of Glasgow’s School of Computing Science explains: 

The SMART engine will be able to answer high-level queries by automatically identifying cameras, microphones and other sensors that can contribute to the query, then synthesise results stemming from distributed sources in an intelligent way. SMART builds upon the existing concept of ‘smart cities’, physical spaces which are covered in an array of intelligent sensors which communicate with each other and can be searched for information. The search results sourced from these smart cities can be reused across multiple applications, making the system more effective. We expect that SMART will be tested in a real city by 2014.",2014-05-04T04:50:17.992218,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'Scotland', 'adminArea1': 'United Kingdom', 'adminArea4': 'City of Glasgow', 'adminArea5': 'Glasgow', 'streetAddress': 'Killermont Street', 'postalCode': 'G2 3', 'formattedAddress': 'Killermont Street, Glasgow, G2 3'}, 'coords': [-4.251806, 55.864237]}",oEintM0QS5OBL1odlzcObA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2012-06-11T13:26:00.000Z,24670-104,ushahidi,SMART City Search Engine,"[{'name': 'Instrumented Landscapes', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Software Services', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Ideas', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:07:48.431505,United Kingdom,Scotland,City of Glasgow,Glasgow,"Killermont Street, Glasgow, G2 3",G2 3,Killermont Street,"{'adminArea3': 'Scotland', 'adminArea1': 'United Kingdom', 'adminArea4': 'City of Glasgow', 'adminArea5': 'Glasgow', 'streetAddress': 'Killermont Street', 'postalCode': 'G2 3', 'formattedAddress': 'Killermont Street, Glasgow, G2 3'}","[-4.251806, 55.864237]",55.864237,-4.251806,Instrumented Landscapes,Software Services,Ideas,en

Note: the word ""commons"" is no where to be found in this document and the Council of Canadians are not listed in the Non-Governmental Organizations resources list. CoC Great Lakes info link also below for review.

The discussion paper linked below is for review and here are the questions they Government asks at the end:

""Questions to Consider

1. To what extent do these Goals and Strategies deal with the stresses and threats that your Great Lakes community faces, as well as the benefits that you want to protect?
2. Are there other Goals for the Great Lakes that you would like to see?
3. What other Strategies should be identified for action to protect the Great Lakes? What do you think is missing?
4. Do you see the role of government changing with this list of Strategies? Do you see the role of local and Aboriginal communities, business, environmental organizations changing based on this list of Great Lakes Strategies?
5. How could the province best act on delivering these proposed Strategies with its stakeholders and others, including Aboriginal communities: for example, education and outreach, voluntary measures by industry, municipal/provincial/business/other, and agricultural stewardship programs, etc.?
6. In your view, are some Strategies more important in achieving a healthier Great Lakes ecosystem than others and, if so, which ones and why? What do you see as the Strategies for your Great Lake community and the whole Great Lakes ecosystem?
7. Are there some Strategies that in your view should be deferred, modified or emphasized at this time given the current state of the economy in Ontario and, if so, which ones?
8. What do you think is the top proposed Strategy for the Great Lakes, and why?
9. Is there any Strategy that in your view might make matters worse for either the environment or the economy or both?
10. What factors in your view are outside the control of the province in protecting the Great Lakes from harm? Does the proposed list of Strategies reflect these factors?
11. Recognizing that lake ecosystems take a long time to change, what do you suggest should be the first focus for action to ensure that Ontario is on a path of success in managing the Great Lakes for the benefit of all and for future generations?
12. Who, in your view, must be involved in short‐term and long‐term strategy setting for managing the health of the Great Lakes?

California gold boulders and gravel were used to create interest and help secure berms in the planting areas.  All plant material is low water and was spaced out appropriately to allow them to keep their natural size and shape as they mature, reducing pruning and its associated green waste. All green waste from pruning goes into my compost bin. Plants provide nectar and habitat for birds, bees and butterflies all year long. Irrigation was converted from spray heads to drip irrigation, using .9 gallon per hour emitters.  Irrigation is not on an automatic controller and is only turned on as needed (usually 4-5 times a year depending on the weather).  Rain barrel is installed to capture water from the roof.  Other wet weather runoff is filtered through the planting areas and captured at the base of the property in a dry riverbed of small boulders and gravel.

2014-05-09 19:07:49.440935,"<b>MIT researchers unveil the EyeStop</b>

""Bus stop of the future"" can sense its surroundings
Imagine if your local bus stop allowed you to check your e-mail, share community information on a digital message board or monitor the local air quality? And perhaps best of all, what if it could tell you the exact location of that bus that you're waiting for?

MIT architects and engineers just unveiled a design for such a bus stop this past Saturday, at the Genio Fiorentino festival in Florence, Italy. (A more formal prototype will be unveiled this October.)Called EyeStop and developed by the MIT SENSEable City Lab, it takes the tedium out of waiting for the bus and showcases the potential of next-generation urban transportation design.

The EyeStop is partially covered with touch-sensitive e-INK and screens, and features state-of-the art sensing technologies and a variety of interactive services. Riders can plan a bus trip on an interactive map, surf the Web, monitor their real-time exposure to pollutants and use their mobile devices as an interface with the bus shelter. They can also post ads and community announcements to an electronic bulletin board at the bus stop, enhancing the EyeStop's functionality as a community gathering space.

""The EyeStop could change the whole experience of urban travel,"" said Carlo Ratti, Head of the SENSEable City Lab at MIT. ""At the touch of a finger, passengers can get the shortest bus route to their destination or the position of all the buses in the city. The EyeStop will also glow at different levels of intensity to signal the distance of an approaching bus.""",2014-05-04T04:50:20.410390,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'Tosc.', 'adminArea1': 'Italy', 'adminArea4': 'FI', 'adminArea5': 'Florence', 'streetAddress': '6 Via dei Leoni', 'postalCode': '50122', 'formattedAddress': '6 Via dei Leoni, 50122 Florence FI'}, 'coords': [11.256901, 43.768732]}",mcV2UaPnQLCEh3vNADghDA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2012-05-03T11:04:00.000Z,24670-99,ushahidi,EyeStop,"[{'name': 'MESH/Smart City Infrastructure', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Instrumented Landscapes', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Transit', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:07:49.440935,Italy,Tosc.,FI,Florence,"6 Via dei Leoni, 50122 Florence FI",50122,6 Via dei Leoni,"{'adminArea3': 'Tosc.', 'adminArea1': 'Italy', 'adminArea4': 'FI', 'adminArea5': 'Florence', 'streetAddress': '6 Via dei Leoni', 'postalCode': '50122', 'formattedAddress': '6 Via dei Leoni, 50122 Florence FI'}","[11.256901, 43.768732]",43.768732,11.256901,MESH/Smart City Infrastructure,Instrumented Landscapes,Transit,en

At least 5,000 megawatts of capacity, including a $5 billion coal-fired plant proposed by Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista, are facing delays or have been shelved as companies including BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Anglo American Plc spend as much as $100 billion on copper and metals projects in Chile.

This dramatic reversal of fortune is why Argentina, already a global financial rogue after its historic debt default, is willing to risk becoming even more of a pariah by seizing control of its leading oil company from Spanish hands, analysts say.

President Cristina Fernandez infuriated Spain, its largest foreign investor, but elated many Argentines by expropriating Repsol YPF SA’s majority stake in Argentina’s formerly state-owned YPF energy company.

Only two months earlier, Repsol YPF had upped its estimate for the shale oil and gas it found in Argentina to nearly 23 billion barrels, enough to double the country’s output in a decade.

""We want to cover the top of nearly every building in the city with trees,"" said Melki.

The impact of the idea is, however, very smart. That's why it is included in MESH Cities. We have noticed that cities that have faced ecological crisis and survived can teach other cities a lot. That's where information technologies come in. They help codify and distribute that information.

It is also planned to build one more unit that will be combined cycle – it can receive natural gas,” he said, referring to Vasilikos.

Cyprus experienced intermittent blackouts in the middle of summer last year after its Vasilikos power station was severely damaged when a cache of seized Iranian munitions exploded at a nearby naval base. A hill between the base and the plant acted as a buffer zone. “If it wasn’t for that hill, we would have been wiped off the island,” Antonis A. Ioannou, Power Station Manager at EAC’s Vasilikos Station, told New Europe during a tour of the plant on 3 April. The damage was evident. Work is in full swing to repair the units and also convert them so that they can use natural gas in addition to fuel oil.

2014-05-09 19:07:35.509149,"The shooting occurred after a fight broke out among a large number of drivers at a highway gas station when dozens of people trying to fill their tanks stormed the station.

Gas station employees fired a barrage of bullets to disperse the drivers and shot the man as he was passing in front of the station. He died immediately and was transferred to a hospital morgue.

On Tuesday, Petroleum Minister Abdullah Ghorab said about 3 million liters of gas were being delivered to gas stations nationwide and that the shortage would be over by Wednesday. At a press conference following the cabinet meeting held to discuss the crisis, Ghorab explained that such shortages occur frequently, but are usually sparked by rumors, which he said is the case for this panic.

2014-05-09 19:07:35.342742,"Across Egypt, long lines of cars and trucks snake around the corner from gas stations, drivers spend the night in their vehicles waiting for fuel at the pumps, and gas stations attendants complain of receiving only half their usual quantity of fuel – or none at all.

Days into an increasingly acute fuel shortage, Egyptians are starting to feel the squeeze. Drivers are searching frantically for fuel, only to find gas stations sold out of key grades of gas. In rural areas, witnesses say scuffles and knife fights have broken out among frustrated drivers. Some have even fired guns in the air.

The reasons behind the shortage – or even if there is one – are not clear. The government blames any shortfall on profiteers reselling subsidized fuel on the black market. Many Egyptians, however, accuse the authorities of trying to cover up what they say is the government’s mismanagement of an ailing economy.

DIY project.
Husband and wife team of amateur gardeners did the research, plant selections (Sunset’s Western Gardens), layout, and with the help of day laborers from West LA Job Center on Exposition Blvd, in the spring/summer 2008, commenced a roughly one year long weekends beautification and water saving project.  Plants, many hundreds, came mostly from Marina del Rey Garden Ctr. and Theodore Payne.

Water.
We did not know of the classes at Surfrider Foundation, so we:
- Rainwater: In the back, we removed 1-2 feet of dirt in a V-shaped trough and replaced with rocks.  What does not seep down, exits on slope with flowering plants.  In the front, downspouts are extended a few feet and empties out over dirt, where a concrete patio once were.
- Irrigation: installed drip irrigation with the 1/4” hose and flag emitters, that is not recommended.  However, each time we water, about every other week when not raining, we walk the garden to spot anything out of order and it works fine for us.  Water usage has fallen to amazingly less than 20% of the usage when we had programmed sprinklers and lawns.  Or, to less than 1/3 of our allotted tier 1 HCF (7 of 24 last month), a bit higher, or up to 1/2 of tier 1 allotment during hot summers.

Living soil sponge.
We also have used the not recommended (too “dead”) bark mulch.  However, since our plants have an abundance of leaves and flowers that fall on top of the mulch, the soil has become alive with micro organisms, worms and the yard is teeming with insects, bees and humming birds, and at least one large alligator lizard that leaves his old skin each year.

We loved the backyard so much that we did the same in the front the following year.  In fall 2010, we converted our garage into a rumpus room and so had the back driveway removed and replaced with more California native plants.  Again, Joel did the design and Salvador's crew the hard-scaping.  All three gardens have flourished.

In its closely-watched monthly oil market report, the IEA said that a series of unscheduled supply outages from Syria to the UK had reached 750,000 barrels a day.

The outages, combined with concerns about Iran, have helped to push crude prices up 20 per cent since December. In recent weeks, prices have posted record highs in euro-denominated terms, surpassing the peak reached during the 2008 price spike.",2014-05-04T04:47:32.709877,,"{'addressComponents': {'formattedAddress': 'Global'}, 'coords': [30, -70]}",NlAlcRmkQLiDarDV1UkASw,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2012-03-14T19:37:00.000Z,15974-909,ushahidi,IEA warns of falling spare oil production capacity,"[{'name': 'Peak Oil', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:07:35.677037,,,,,Global,,,{'formattedAddress': 'Global'},"[30, -70]",-70.0,30.0,Peak Oil,,,en

2014-05-09 19:07:49.349091,"A model for a new private utility vehicle company that owns and operates carports throughout the city (airports, carports encourage mobility, unlike car parks), equipped with small, efficient & environmentally friendly cars, called reCARs.

CHALLENGE
A typical office worker drives into the city in the morning and leaves the city for home around sundown. Even in the most traditional work cycle that’s an 8 hour stretch of her car sitting idle waiting for the return trip. Chances are it’s a single occupancy vehicle. Multiply that by every office worker in the city and you have the single largest collection of idle metal concentrated in massive concrete structures called parking spaces. This creates massive dead spaces within cities. 

Further, due to the cost of parking, people are discouraged from traveling within the city during leisure hours (ie lunch) for fear of having to pay additional parking charges at every stop they make. The purpose of the car in this typical model is merely to ferry an individual to a single point and to obediently await its masters return. This is an extremely inefficient use of transportation. 
How can we provide an efficient model to transport people from residential areas into the city without 1) sacrificing their mobility within the city and 2) sacrificing public spaces in favour of car parks.
SOLUTION
A new private utility vehicle company owns and operates carports throughout the city (like airports, carports encourage mobility, unlike car parks), equipped with small, efficient & environmentally friendly cars, called reCARs. 

Commuters use public transportation to get to work, either via trains, bus etc. They are then able to hire a reCAR at various points throughout the city for intra city commute, leaving their reCARs at the carport closest to their destination. 

These cars will run on natural gas and since it is for short commutes within the city, the usual disadvantages of sacrificing boot space for fuel storage does not apply. reCARS are also exempt from parking fess for short term road side parking, thereby encouraging mobility and interaction within the city. For example, one is able to hire a reCAR to get to a lunch appointment and make a quick stop at the post office on the way back to work without having to pay additional parking charges at each stop. 

The result of the solution is threefold: 1) open up spaces by reducing the number of car parks in the inner city; 2) reduce the number of vehicles commuting into and out of the city (which is the prime reason for traffic jams) and 3) reducing dependency on private vehicle ownership and its positive implications for the environment. 
ECONOMIC IMPACT
1. Increases ridership on public transport system and therefore revenues for public transportation authorities to invest back into public services. 

2. Encourages greater mobility within the city and therefore economic gains for shopfronts by putting in place incentives like free roadside parking for reCARS. 

3. Consumer savings by not having to drive into the city everyday, avoiding daily parking charges and overall petrol costs associated with daily driving. 
COMMUNITY IMPACT
1. Reducing travel times into and out of the city by reducing the number of cars on the roads during peak hours. 

2. Improves quality of life by reducing significant time wasted waiting in traffic and therefore increasing productivity. 

3. Typically, most people remained confined within their block due to the challenges of venturing out further. Communities are locked in one place for the whole day. This system encourages intracity connectivity.",2014-05-04T04:50:19.196985,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'Capital Region', 'adminArea1': 'Denmark', 'adminArea4': 'København', 'adminArea5': 'København V', 'streetAddress': 'H.

2014-05-09 19:07:50.386395,"CHALLENGE
In recent years, the amount of travel content available online has grown tremendously. Yet instead of helping travelers, it often overwhelms them due to sheer volume of information, and lack of tools to manage it. Simply put, travelers entering a new city are always faced with the time-consuming task of finding-out, ""what is there to do here?"", ""how do I get there?"", ""do I have enough time?"". Citybot research has shown that the average traveler spends as little as 30 minutes, but as much as 3 hours researching activities for a single day in a new city. How can travelers bypass the time consuming process of researching local attractions that interest them, then finding the locations, hours of operations, efficient routes to get to each and back, and make the process empowering?

SOLUTION
Citybot's sifts through mountains of travel content such as hours of operation, travel times, distances, available transportation methods, ratings, etc. Users don't waste time reading about interesting sites or activities that aren't open or are too far away for them to enjoy in the time they have. Our proprietary engine analyzes all this information and creates complete actionable itineraries that contain only the things that a traveler wants to do, organized in a way that is easy to follow and optimized specifically for them. Citybot supplies each traveler with the best options for them, based on their location, transportation options, the time they have, and their interests.

2014-05-09 19:07:51.232955,"Paraimpu is a new social tool for the Web of Things: http://paraimpu.crs4.it/ 

Basically it allows users to:

1. connect physical and virtual things to the Web: real objects, Arduino boards, sensors, Karots,..., entertainment appliances but also existing social networks, APIs, software applications, services on the Web and so on...briefly, everything capable to ""speak"" HTTP. Paraimpu provides a palette of supported objects in order to help users to connect their objects to the system with zero or minimal configuration.


2. inter-connect these things: it's always possible to create a connection between two objects despite their nature: physical or virtual, so it is possible to connect, for example a set of environmental sensors to facebook or to a stepper motor to drive or move something in real-time. Moreover, it is possible to connect Twitter to my lighting system or to whatever I need. Due to the very heterogeneous nature of objects, Paraimpu provides a rule-based powerful mechanism in order to adapt/transform/filter data flowing from an object to a connected one. E.g., if I connect a CO2 Sensor And I want to drive my appliance in order to reduce emissions (a motor for example), maybe I have to map and transform data which comes from the former before forwarding to the latter. Paraimpu adopts a rule engine and the users are able to write from simple to also very complex rules to do that, it's a system responsability to enforce these rules in real-time when data flows.

3. It is social: users can share their objects with other people/friends setting a policy for each owned thing: private, public, moderated, ... This allows to avoid waste in buying similar objects for the same purpose, sharing them with other people. For example, if I've bought a temperature sensor, installed in my balcony and I've connected it to the system, maybe other people in my city need the same data, why force them to buy and install and connect the same object for the same purpose? Share it! Through Paraimpu! And let users use it in their connections with their own things.",2014-05-04T04:50:41.482180,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'Sard.', 'adminArea1': 'Italy', 'adminArea4': 'CA', 'adminArea5': 'Pula', 'streetAddress': 'Via Nora', 'postalCode': '09010', 'formattedAddress': 'Via Nora, 09010 Pula CA'}, 'coords': [9.002667, 39.008611]}",kA-5j6emRe-5Bga0zWfLyw,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2012-01-12T01:02:00.000Z,24670-87,ushahidi,Paraimpu,"[{'name': 'MESH/Smart City Infrastructure', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Software Services', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Ideas', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Anything Else', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:07:51.232955,Italy,Sard.,CA,Pula,"Via Nora, 09010 Pula CA",09010,Via Nora,"{'adminArea3': 'Sard.', 'adminArea1': 'Italy', 'adminArea4': 'CA', 'adminArea5': 'Pula', 'streetAddress': 'Via Nora', 'postalCode': '09010', 'formattedAddress': 'Via Nora, 09010 Pula CA'}","[9.002667, 39.008611]",39.008611,9.002667,MESH/Smart City Infrastructure,Software Services,Ideas,en

2014-05-09 19:07:50.298948,"How to find city parking spaces on the cheap-from the spotscout.com blog:

Thinking of posting your home or work parking spots when they are empty or idle? Well, you’re smart. WAY smart. If so, we’d like to present you with a little basic math that will persuade you exactly why that really IS a good idea. Below are two examples of the potential that an empty parking space has to earn you money.

So, let’s start with posting it only on the weekdays: 

You have a great parking spot near a busy area and it’s empty every day while you’re at work for 8 hrs. (Who only works 8 hours these days, right?) A nearby garage or parking lot charges people $4 an hr. but after 2 hrs. the price jumps to an all day price of say, $25. (This is actually conservative. Many cities or suburban areas where parking is constrained charge much more daily.) Now you post your one parking spot for slightly less - let’s say, $20 for one full day - on SpotScout. Weekly, that could earn you $100 or $400 MONTHLY. That’d pay a couple of bills wouldn’t it?!

Let’s try another example but this time, we’ll do it hourly. You post your parking spot for $4 an hr., rather than giving it a flat daily price. That’d be $32 you could earn for an 8 hr. reservation for just ONE parking space! Weekly, that could be $160 and monthly, $640. That could cover a lot of dinners out, maybe even a plane ticket to someplace warm and sandy.

Here are also few basics thoughts to consider, too.

1) A parking spot as ‘a commodity’ rarely can be damaged - no matter how often it is used or exchanges hands. This makes it extremely easy to trade with others. 
2) With SpotScout, you can set the ground rules of its use by others. E.G. ‘Please don’t and leave trash’, ‘don’t stay late’, or ‘keep noise to a minimum.’ You also rate the reserving party you’re trading with after it’s over.
3) You can charge WHATEVER you feel the demand at the moment will pay for it. Think it’ll go for $40 a day, or $100 for an entire weekend or for the big game? Go for it!! Daily, Nightly, Hourly, SpotScout gives you ALL the options for your spot to earn the most it can!

2014-05-09 19:07:51.320309,"Urbanflow is a joint effort of Nordkapp and Urbanscale, and envisions an operating system for cities.

The general challenge is that while cities are fast, municipal decision making is slow by nature. The heavy and invisible decision-making process within cities causes disconnect with citizens, and despite an abundance of commercial messaging platforms, there is yet to be a dedicated platform where the city and its citizens can meet.

Existing commercial messaging tries to get attention by being 'the loudest voice' in the city and attempting to occupy the most space. We believe that city space should be shared equally between citizens and corporations and that a compromise is possible. We know that there are better and more subtle ways to negotiate the co-existence of commercial, corporate, municipal and citizen-authored content in the city.

Our vision is to make the city more accessible and enjoyable for both residents and visitors through a situated interactive service. By sharing real-time data and feedback about the city, we aim to create a more efficient, transparent relationship between city administrators and citizens.

2014-05-09 19:07:51.500087,"N Building is a commercial structure located near Tachikawa station amidst a shopping district. Being a commercial building signs or billboards are typically attached to its facade which we feel undermines the structures' identity. As a solution we thought to use a QR Code as the facade itself. By reading the QR Code with your mobile device you will be taken to a site which includes up to date shop information. In this manner we envision a cityscape unhindered by ubiquitous signage and also an improvement to the quality and accuracy of the information itself.

December 15th, 2009 we held an opening which included the limited release of an iPhone application made specifically for N Building. If a QR Code is static, what could we do with a dynamic device like the iPhone? Our proposed vision of the future is one where the facade of the building disappears, showing those inside who want to be seen. As you press on the characters their comments made on online appear in speech bubbles. You can also browse shop information, make reservations and download coupons. Rather than broadly tagging, we display information specific to the building in a manner in which the virtual (iPhone) serves to enhance the physical (N Building). Our goal is to provide an incentive to visit the space and a virtual connection to space without necessarily being present.

BMA noted that Chao Phraya river at Bang Sai, Ayuthaya was 3.17 metres above mean sea level, a decline of 6cm.

The Chao Phraya river at Pak Khlong Talat was highest at 8.15 at 2.15 metres above mean sea level, 65cm below bank.

Don Muang saw water decline about 3cm. Khlong Prem Pachakorn saw decline of 2-7cm, Khlong Bangkhen at 4-7cm, Khlong Lat Phra 4-7cm, Khlong Bang Sue 5-7cm, Khlong Hokwa and Khlong Song  2cm.

On the western side, Khlong Mahasawat at Thawee Wattana sluice gate saw a decline of 3cm.

The cleaning up activity will be held in other areas after the floodwater has receded to make Bangkok clean before the coming New Year festival, he added.

2014-05-09 19:10:06.856564,"Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said on Saturday that the government’s flood war room had confirmed that areas in inner Bangkok will not be flooded.

In her “Yingluck government meets people” weekly talk show on radio stations of the Public Relations Department broadcast from Indonesia this morning, Ms Yinluck said officials can hold mass volume of runoff from the North at Khlong Bang Sue.

This can prevent inner areas of Victory Monument, Pathumwan and Silom from floods, she added.

The floodwater inundating the districts of Bang Phlad, Bangkok Noi, Bang Khae, Bang Kruai and Nakhon Chaisi has been gradually receding. The Royal Irrigation Department reported that about 63 million cubic metre of water has been draining out from the areas per day, she said.

On the conflict between flood victims in Khlong Hok Wa and Khlong Mahasawat and state authorities, the problems had been settled by the Flood Relief Operations Command, said Ms Yingluck.

The Rama 2 road, a main highway to the South, will also not be inundated as some fear and that the flood situation is improving in several provinces, including Singburi, she added

The prime minister insisted that after the water recedes, the government will rapidly reconstruct flooded provinces and rehabilitate flood affected people and manufacturers.

2014-05-09 19:07:53.701141,"It will be months before the provincial government will be able to tally its flood bill, but it's sure to exceed what was budgeted.

While several government ministries are currently unable to predict the final cost, next spring's budget will surely see expenses soar by hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of flood relief.

Manitoba Premier Greg Selinger recently said the cost of fighting floods and compensating victims in that province is expected to be more than $550 million.

Saskatchewan's Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure is one department that has already been hit hard financially.

Many highways in southeast Saskatchewan are still covered with water and Jim Reiter, minister of highways and infrastructure, said employees are working at full capacity. The ministry has been forced to bring in contractors whenever they are available.

While some extra costs will be incurred to hire contractors, the majority of the financial burden will be repairing highways.

""In all likelihood the cost will probably be significantly higher this year,"" said Reiter. ""It's just unprecedented what is happening right now. It's generally impossible to plan for something that is so far out of the ordinary.""

Last year, the Ministry spent an estimated $10 million in the Maple Creek area alone. The Ministry is still working on evaluating what the cost will be this year.

""It's in the tens of millions of dollars and, unfortunately, it seems to be growing every day,"" he said. ""We've been taking up a lot of resources dealing with emergencies as opposed to routine work.""

Reiter was optimistic a lot of the costly repairs will qualify under disaster assistance funding from the federal government.

Cam Swan, general manager of the Provincial Disaster Assistance Program (PDAP), said they are still finalizing claims from last year and this year's price tag won't be known for quite some time.

PDAP received over 6,100 claims last year.

So far, approximately 2,000 applications have already been filed and there will be a lot more coming, Swan said.

""It affected a wider area (this year) but I don't know if that will translate into more applications or dollars,"" he said.

Some assistance has already been provided to flood victims. Approximately 210 applicants who were displaced from their homes received an immediate $3,000 payment from PDAP.

The ministry has also made several hundred payments for emergency repairs, but Swan was unsure of the total cost.

In most cases, homeowners need to complete repairs before PDAP will reimburse them.

Staffing and hiring adjusters is another additional cost for PDAP. Its staff is already about 10 times larger than it was last year and Swan said more employees will be needed as more claims come in.

SaskPower has also incurred additional costs this year as a result of the weather.

""The storms we've seen over the last few weeks have been more costly than the flooding,"" said James Parker, spokesman for SaskPower. ""It's safe to say we are going to be spending more on maintenance and construction for our transmission and distribution system this year.""

Parker said SaskPower was in a strong financial position to withstand the extra cost of repairing downed power poles and other infrastructure damage.

""We are not tracking the impact of the flooding but we do know that there was a cost associated with not having Boundary Dam power station able to generate at maximum capacity,"" he said. ""Because we can't maximize coal-fire production, we're burning more natural gas and importing more electricity and that boosts our costs.""

For the agriculture sector, the next few months will reveal the harsh financial impact of unseeded crops.

Crop insurance, which has been upped to $70 per unseeded acre, will bring an even heftier price tag come budget time.",2014-05-04T04:51:20.263798,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Roche Percee', 'streetAddress': 'Souris Ave & Division Ave', 'postalCode': 'S0C', 'formattedAddress': 'Souris Ave & Division Ave, Roche Percee, SK S0C, Canada'}, 'coords': [-102.801397, 49.068562]}",zG2agKuTT-iw8z8ln5lKvg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-07-05T19:07:00.000Z,14521-317,ushahidi,Cost of flooding in Sask. largely unknown,"[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'High Water Levels', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:07:53.701141,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Roche Percee,"Souris Ave & Division Ave, Roche Percee, SK S0C, Canada",S0C,Souris Ave & Division Ave,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Roche Percee', 'streetAddress': 'Souris Ave & Division Ave', 'postalCode': 'S0C', 'formattedAddress': 'Souris Ave & Division Ave, Roche Percee, SK S0C, Canada'}","[-102.801397, 49.068562]",49.068562,-102.801397,Flood Hazards,High Water Levels,,en
2014-05-09 19:07:56.272488,"A second portion of Highway 47 in southeast Saskatchewan was closed on Monday due to this year's flooding.

Highway 47 was shut down from Stoughton to the junction with Highway 361. Doug Wakabayashi from the Saskatchewan Ministry of Highways said they are installing a culvert for Highway 47, which will help mitigate the water that has been appearing on the highway three kilometres north of Benson.

Benson area residents have been pumping water onto the highway in an effort to save the community from flood waters.

Wakabayashi expects that the latest affected part of Highway 47 would be open on Wednesday, but there was a chance the highway could be open on Tuesday.

Highway 47 south of Estevan is expected to be open on Tuesday, Wakabayashi said. Highway 47 from the junction with Highway 18 to the U.S. border has been closed since June 20, when flood waters from the Souris River washed out part of the north side of the bridge.

Sheet piles have been driven in to protect the bridge from erosion, Wakabayashi said. The damaged areas of the bridge have been filled in with a pit run aggregate.

The pit run was covered with gravel, and then it was sealed with pavement. 

As for the flooding situation, Rafferty Dam Reservoir's depth is at around 552.3 metres, and it continues to decline. The reservoir is now less than a metre from its full supply level.

Boundary Dam Reservoir is at about 560.9 metres, and water levels from that reservoir are also starting to decline.

Water releases from the two reservoirs into the Souris River were a combined 165 cubic metres per second as of Monday afternoon, and they have been steadily declining for nearly two weeks.

Outflows for the Souris River are at about 155 cubic metres per second (m3/s). Rafferty Dam is supplying about 150 m3/s; the rest is coming from the Boundary Dam Reservoir.

2014-05-09 19:07:54.859721,"Residents of Cumberland House continue to watch water levels rise around the northern community.

Water levels were expected to peak July 1. The Saskatchewan Watershed Authority (SWA) now reports levels will continue to rise.

Cumberland Lake is gaining about 10 centimetres per day and is expected to peak at 264 metres above sea level later this week or early next week. Levels are higher than earlier forecasts. Peak levels are expected to be more than half a metre higher than 2005 flood levels.

Last weekend additional berm construction was done to ensure the community is ready for the rising water, and plans are in place in case high river levels impact the road leading into the community. The community declared a state of emergency June 22 and has worked to ensure necessary supplies are in place should the highway be closed.

""It looks like they should be in pretty good shape,"" said Colin King, with the Ministry of Corrections, Public Safety and Policing.

As of Monday morning, the highway to the communities of Cumberland House Cree Nation and the village of Cumberland House was passable for all vehicles. Within the past week, water had covered the top of the road, but has since receded.

Water levels at Candle Lake, about 220 kilometres north of Saskatoon, are still very high but are declining.

""As long as it doesn't get a bunch more rain, water levels will be going down,"" said Dale Hjertaas, executive director of policy and communications at the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority (SWA).

Near Saskatoon, outflow from the Gardiner Dam was reduced Monday from 1,500 cubic metres per second to 900. The highest flow rate through Saskatoon in recent years was in 2005, when the rate peaked at 1,805 cubic metres per second.

2014-05-09 19:07:55.123067,"Lake-bound Saskatchewan residents got some good news for Canada Day weekend as flood conditions are improving and high water levels are going down slowly.

Luckily, the severe thunderstorm on Wednesday night throughout southern Saskatchewan did not have a significant impact on flood-affected areas.

Dale Hjertaas, who is executive director of policy and communications for the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority, said the full extent of the storm will not be known until later this coming week.

However, he did have good news on Thursday.

Rafferty reservoir is continuing to decline and the outflows were decreased 30 cubic metres per second since Wednesday.

He expects similar daily reductions to continue throughout the weekend.

Buffalo Pound Lake has been rising, but Hjertaas said it may be at its peak level, half a metre above it's normal level, but he is not expecting it to get much higher.

The Buffalo Pound Water Treatment Plant was shutdown at 9: 45 on Wednesday night due to a power failure caused by the storm.

During the temporary shutdown, the City of Regina used wells and reservoirs from the City of Moose Jaw to supply water for the city.

Residents may notice a difference in water taste and clarity over the next few days as water works its way through the water system.

2014-05-09 19:07:54.634975,"The worst of the flooding for the Souris River in southeast Saskatchewan appears to be over, but for residents of Lampman and Benson, their battles with water continue.

The Town of Lampman has several measures to keep the encroaching flood waters from swamping the town, says Mayor Scott Greening. Dikes have been constructed. An estimated 50,000 sandbags have been filled and placed, offering protection for the town's north and northwest border.

About 25 per cent of the town's perimeter is guarded by the dikes and the sandbags, Greening said.

Water has crept to the edge of the town, but Greening said it had yet to approach or endanger any homes or businesses in the community.

“We have diked up our newest commercial subdivision on the northwest corner of town,” said Greening.

Volunteers have contributed significant time and equipment to complete earthworks and keep Lampman safe, Greening said. Many nearly worked non-stop for several days.

Greening believes that the people of Lampman have been very pro-active with their flood protection measures.

“With water, that's something you have to be,” said Greening. “You have to be ahead of it. If it gets ahead of you, you'll be too late.”

There has also been work in the RM of Browning, where residents have witnessed the flooding of many fields. Access roads have been cut off. Only a couple of farms have been vacated, and Greening said those people left willingly.

Flooding is also under control in Benson. Water flowed into the hamlet's northern area on June 21, forcing a mobilization of volunteers and equipment. Sandbags were stacked and dikes were constructed. Those structures are holding up, said RM of Benson administrator Laureen Keating, and keeping the water at bay.

“We feel like we're in control of the situation now, and we feel that we can handle the next time that this might happen,” said Keating.

There's still a lot of water that could flow to Benson, but it isn't moving very fast.

“If it keeps going at the pace that it is, we should be able to control it, and keep it moving on,” said Keating.

Sandbags were placed around the village hall, the Catholic church and the curling rink, which are all in north Benson. None of the buildings were damaged.

In addition to filling and placing sandbags and constructing berms and dikes, volunteers were also busy preparing meals for the other workers, Keating said.

Three families were evacuated from the hamlet when the waters arrived. At least two properties in the RM also had to be evacuated. A lot of roads in the RM remain under water and impassible.

Residents displaced by the flooding had yet to return to their homes, as of June 28.

Water was crossing Highway 47 three kilometres north of Benson, said Doug Wakabayashi from the Ministry of Highways. As of right now, there aren't any plans to close the highway, but people should be prepared to stop.

As for the Souris River, outflows into the Souris were at 280 cubic metres per second (m3/s) as of noon on June 28. The Saskatchewan Watershed Authority (SWA) closed the spillway for Boundary Dam on the 28th. Rafferty Dam was the only reservoir pumping water into the Souris.

Dale Hjertaas from the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority said that releases from Rafferty are diminishing because the reservoir levels are dropping, so there is less pressure to push the water through the spillway.

The outflows were at the lowest point since June 17, when they were about 120 m3/s. Peak flows on June 21 were 770 m3/s.

Roche Percee deputy mayor Sharon Wells said that the Souris is slowly starting to recede through her community. People who had five feet of water in their homes now have a foot or a foot-and-a-half of water. Several people have been able to briefly return to their homes.

“The river is going down,” said Wells. “The first couple of days, it went down really, really fast. It's not going down quite as fast now. We wish it would go down faster.”

SaskTel is working very hard to restore telephone service in the community, Wells said. SaskEnergy will be able to restore service once the Souris' levels diminish, and the turn-off valves can be reached.

Wells doesn't know when the Roche Percee access road will be open again. There is still a lot of water on the road. Between 10 and 12 feet of water remains on First Street.

Roche Percee residents are grateful for the support that they have received since they were forced to evacuate, she said. Many fundraisers have taken place to support the victims of the flooding, and people in neighbouring communities have been very hospitable.

The RM of Coalfields has also been hit hard by flooding. Interim administrator Valerie Pelton said 25 people have been evacuated from the RM.

Nine trailers have been brought into the community to accommodate evacuees from Roche Percee and the RM. Seven trailers were filled as of June 27. Two more trailers will arrive in early July.

The trailers are located between the Bienfait Memorial Arena and the Bienfait Curling Rink.

“We're taking care of our people in the RM who are displaced right now, and don't have accommodations available to them,” said Pelton.

She doesn't know how long the trailers will remain in the community. Pelton leased them for two months, and there is an option to renew the lease.

The trailers have power and water hook-ups, and the Town of Bienfait takes care of sewer service. Evacuees also have access to showers, washrooms and the kitchen inside of the arena.

The Town of Bienfait, meanwhile, is urging people to not ride four-wheel quads or dirt bikes on the pasture land behind the town's landfill south of the community. There are many underground coal mines in the pasture. The ground is very unstable due to the high water table from all of the rain.

New sinkholes and cave-ins are appearing daily.

Several highways were closed as of June 29 due to the flooding: Highway 18 from the junction of Highway 47 to the Junction of Highway 350; Highway 47 from the U.S. Border to the junction with Highway 18; Highway 350 from the U.S. border to the junction with Highway 18; and Highway 9 from the U.S. border to the junction with Highway 18.

There is still water on Highway 39 northwest of Macoun.

Traffic returned to normal on Highway 39 through the Roche Percee Valley on June 27.

SaskPower has resumed shipping coal to the Boundary Dam Power Station. Kelly Panteluk Construction was at the Rafferty Dam Road on June 25 to improve the road's condition.

Coal is being transported from mines east of Estevan to Boundary Dam by travelling through Estevan and by using the Rafferty Dam Road. Boundary Dam is now producing about 640 megawatts of electricity, which is still below capacity. The power station was producing about 200 megawatts in late June, when coal shipments were halted due to flooding.

A recovery centre that was located at St. Joseph's Hospital in Estevan is now closed. Colin King from the Ministry of Corrections, Public Safety and Policing said more than 175 people visited the centre from when it opened on June 23, until it closed on June 28.",2014-05-04T04:51:31.825460,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Lampman', 'streetAddress': '116 Railway Ave', 'postalCode': 'S0C', 'formattedAddress': '116 Railway Ave, Lampman, SK S0C, Canada'}, 'coords': [-102.750921, 49.38336]}",EVh7pEkZR3aETt68LoLu-g,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-06-30T22:11:00.000Z,14521-313,ushahidi,The flood fight rages on,"[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:07:54.634975,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Lampman,"116 Railway Ave, Lampman, SK S0C, Canada",S0C,116 Railway Ave,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Lampman', 'streetAddress': '116 Railway Ave', 'postalCode': 'S0C', 'formattedAddress': '116 Railway Ave, Lampman, SK S0C, Canada'}","[-102.750921, 49.38336]",49.38336,-102.750921,Flood Hazards,,,en

2014-05-09 19:07:55.836270,"Flood watchers say the water will keep rising in two southeastern Saskatchewan communities, but relief is coming for the region.

The Saskatchewan Watershed Authority said Monday that water levels are going up in Lampman, about 190 kilometres southeast of Regina, and in Benson, about 160 kilometres southeast of the capital city.

""It's happening slowly. It will probably keep rising for maybe the next two weeks,"" said authority spokesman Dale Hjertaas.

Hjertaas said it's tough to know how high the water will get. Lampman and Benson are not on a river so there's no metering station. Hjertaas said watershed officials are on the scene to try to get a better understanding of what will happen.

""But it's hard for us to estimate when it's something we've never seen before and it's not on a river system where we have some idea how it normally flows.""

Duane McKay, the province's director of emergency response, said people in Lampman and Benson are doing what they can to hold off the water.

""There are significant pumping operations going on in Lampman to try and move the water over highways and any obstructions,"" he said. ""There is diking going on in that area to protect the community. Actually there's two stages of diking — one right along the body of water that is impinging on the community, plus there are backup dikes along the streets,"" he continued.

""There is a lot of work being done there in order to withstand the coming water for a period of time.

""The water flows coming down through Benson are moving along, but this is a very flat piece of land, so the water is spread out a long ways and there isn't a lot of quick movement of that water.""

The watershed authority issued warnings months ago that said there was a high likelihood of flooding from spring runoff, especially in the southern part of the province.

The combination of runoff and heavy rain over the last few weeks has filled reservoirs to the brim. The watershed said it was forced to release water from the Rafferty, Boundary and Alameda dams and that caused flooding in the Estevan area.

Much of the village of Roche Percee, just east of Estevan near the U.S. border, remained underwater Monday. The village was flooded more than a week ago when water from the swollen Souris River overwhelmed a dike.

Estevan-area Mounties said Monday that they were increasing patrols in the flooded areas after reports that several empty homes have been robbed. The RCMP said there have been five break-ins since Wednesday. Stolen property includes two wide screen TVs, liquor and small items such as an Ipad.

Roche Percee Mayor Reg Jahn said on the weekend that his own home had been robbed twice.

There was some good news Monday.

The watershed authority said overall water levels are going down on the Souris River system, which runs in the waterlogged southeast.

Highway 39 — a major route connecting Regina to the U.S. border — was reopened to all traffic after being closed because of flooding. And cleanup crews were pulling out of the southeastern city of Weyburn, which was hit by a deluge of rain June 17.

But McKay warned that people in the southeast shouldn't put the sandbags away just yet.

""It's sort of slowing down, which is a very good sign,"" he said.

""But we're still being very vigilant in our alert status simply because we don't know what the weather will bring. We're kind of encouraged by a trend of sunny weather and warm, but we'll wait and see.

""We don't want to react too quickly in terms of ramping down our level of readiness.""",2014-05-04T04:51:39.946679,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Lampman', 'streetAddress': 'Railway Ave', 'postalCode': 'S0C', 'formattedAddress': 'Railway Ave, Lampman, SK S0C, Canada'}, 'coords': [-102.75, 49.383]}",-GcjuZIvQjmRBOHEPYBCTw,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-06-27T15:31:00.000Z,14521-311,ushahidi,"Water rising in two Saskatchewan towns, but dropping in waterlogged southeast","[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:07:55.836270,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Lampman,"Railway Ave, Lampman, SK S0C, Canada",S0C,Railway Ave,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Lampman', 'streetAddress': 'Railway Ave', 'postalCode': 'S0C', 'formattedAddress': 'Railway Ave, Lampman, SK S0C, Canada'}","[-102.75, 49.383]",49.383,-102.75,Flood Hazards,,,en
2014-05-09 19:07:54.757999,"The flood situation appears to be over in Moose Jaw. On Thursday a flood watch for the Moose Jaw River was issued but that advisory was lifted this morning.

Mayor Glenn Hagel says the local river didn't rise by as much as first predicted, which is definitely a good thing.

""We ended up going up some 45cm. Its now gone back down about 40cm,"" Hagel said. ""However, having said that, the river continues to run very strong and is dangerous to be on and I'm still asking that people stay off the river. There is still a lot of debris in the river.""

Hagel says there was minimal damage in Wakamow because of the rise in water level this weekend. The only areas really affected were the extremely low lying parts of the valley, right up against the river banks.

""This could have been prevented for sure. If they would of yanked the logs Monday morning and drained the creek again, you could have handled this 4ft. But when the water is already at a nice level and you put 4ft on top of that, no it can't handle it,"" said Rick Klein, owner of one of two homes in Wakamow that are on the banks of the Moose Jaw River.

Klein believes the city had a chance to prevent his yard from being flooded this weekend as the river rose by half a metre.

Klein says the information was out there, indicating the river was going to rise and there was more than enough time to remove logs from the CPR Dam to drop the river levels. 

Moose Jaw Mayor Glenn Hagel argues it's not as easy to control the river level as Klein is promoting. Hagel says removing logs from the dam takes a large crane and a lot of work each time.

""That' something that has to be arranged in advance, the city doesn't have a crane. There is some planning and a fair chunk of work that is involved with putting both logs in or removing them,"" says Hagel.

Hagel says it's an old dam and it's not easily done and that's why it needs to be replaced and will be replaced in 2012.",2014-05-04T04:51:32.983891,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Moose Jaw', 'streetAddress': '1057 Main St N', 'postalCode': 'S6H 0X2', 'formattedAddress': '1057 Main St N, Moose Jaw, SK S6H 0X2, Canada'}, 'coords': [-105.534447, 50.400053]}",1gNmVvJfQHOH2iUM8PQbsw,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-06-27T14:15:00.000Z,14521-310,ushahidi,Moose Jaw Flood Advisory Lifted,"[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:07:54.757999,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Moose Jaw,"1057 Main St N, Moose Jaw, SK S6H 0X2, Canada",S6H 0X2,1057 Main St N,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Moose Jaw', 'streetAddress': '1057 Main St N', 'postalCode': 'S6H 0X2', 'formattedAddress': '1057 Main St N, Moose Jaw, SK S6H 0X2, Canada'}","[-105.534447, 50.400053]",50.400053,-105.534447,Flood Hazards,,,en
2014-05-09 19:07:56.903049,"The Saskatchewan Watershed Authority (SWA) continues to decrease water releases from Boundary Dam into the Souris River.

As of Monday at noon, releases were at 380 cubic metres per second (m3/s). Boundary Dam was pumping out 80 m3/s, while releases from Rafferty were steady at 300 m3/s.

Outflows into the Souris River were at 490 m3/s on Friday. Boundary Dam supplied 190 m3/s of the outflows. But the SWA cut the outflows from Boundary to 120 m3/s on Saturday and 80 m3/s on Sunday – an encouraging sign for flood-weary residents of southeast Saskatchewan.

A decrease of inflows at Boundary Dam was expected on Monday, which would result in another reduction in outflows as well. Water levels on Boundary Dam are at their lowest point since early April.

Duane McKay from Corrections, Public Safety and Policing said that Benson and Lampman are locations that they're watching closely. Water pumps and dikes have been constructed in the Lampman area to battle the water.

He expects that anti-flooding measures will continue in those two communities for a couple of weeks.

The Town of Lampman has requested assistance with sandbagging.

One case of theft has been reported from the Roche Percee area, said McKay. Police have been patrolling the area to prevent further looting from tto ensure that  Percee area, said McKay. Patrols are ongoing in Roche Percee.  Highways, Lampman,aking place.

Local motorists have also received some good news, as traffic flow is back to normal on Highway 39 through the Roche Percee Valley. The highway had been down to one lane of traffic, as there was water on the highway, for much of last week. Heavy truck traffic had to be diverted to another location.

Highway 39 near Macoun, and Highway 47 between Benson and Stoughton, still have one lane of traffic open due to water on the road.

Highway closures in the area include: Highway 47 from the U.S. border to the junction with Highway 18; Highway 18 from the junction of Highway 47 to the junction with Highway 350; Highway 9 from the U.S. border to the junction with Highway 18; and Highway 350 from the U.S. border to the junction with Highway 18.

The Estevan Police Service and the Estevan Fire and Rescue Service require residents to stay away from affected areas. Anyone caught disobeying barricades or road closures will be charged, with an immediate court date.

The Rafferty Dam Access Road was reinforced on Saturday morning so that it could handle heavy truck traffic that is being used to transport coal to the Boundary Dam Power Station.

About 8,000 tonnes of coal are being trucked into Boundary Dam each day.

Boundary Dam's power output is at about 500 megawatts during the day, said SaskPower spokesperson James Parker, which is a little more than half of its normal output.

The Estevan Recovery Service Centre at St. Joseph’s Hospital is available for flood and water damage victims, including seepage issues. The service centre will be open from 9 a.m. to noon on Tuesday, and then it will be closed afterwards.

Application forms for the Provincial Disaster Assistance Program will be available at City Hall.

Residents are reminded that flood waters are extremely dangerous. Floating debris and other water hazards above and beneath the surface are dangerous for all watercraft. All power lines are energized and should be considered dangerous.

2014-05-09 19:07:55.621338,"While sunny skies in southern Saskatchewan over the weekend helped flood waters recede, some areas are still bracing for peaks rivalling those seen during spring run-off.

Provincial officials who have been grappling with the flooding sounded more optimistic Sunday than a week ago after heavy rains left some communities swamped — but they also know any gains could be fleeting if the skies open up again.

“Any substantial rain will bring everything back up,” Dale Hjertaas of the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority said Sunday. He noted the ground is so saturated, it has no ability to absorb any rainwater, so it runs off and impacts river flows — adding to flooding some areas have battled since April. However, drier weather at least creates more capacity in reservoirs like Rafferty. “Flows of course are still pretty high right now even if they are going down,” said Hjertaas.

With high water levels causing access problems in Estevan, chemicals had to be brought in by helicopter to the water treatment plant. It was better news in Weyburn, where the threat of flooding has passed.

Further south, water levels in devastated Roche Percee — where some homes had water up to the eaves last week — were still roughly two metres high. “The water has dramatically decreased because of the flows, almost about half of what they were,” said Duane McKay, commissioner of emergency management and fire safety. He added that access to the community is still a problem so evacuees haven’t yet been allowed to return.

Also in the southeast, Benson was still dealing with flooding, while water was rising in the Lampman area, causing some people to relocate with friends and family although the community hasn’t been evacuated. The town’s potable water supply and water filtration have been sandbagged. “Hopefully all of those protections will remain in place and not be threatened by the incoming water,” said McKay.

With school out this week and more people heading to the lake, McKay was reminding people to tread carefully.

“In some of the flows and the creeks that we’ve seen, even if there isn’t flooding in a particular area, we might see some erosion to banks,” he said, advising people against getting too close.

Caution is also needed on the lakes, since levels are expected to remain high. “We can’t guarantee that there isn’t debris in the lake ... As well, within so many metres of the shore, your local boat wake can cause damage to people’s hard work as they’re putting up sandbags,” he said.

Last Mountain Lake is continuing to rise as water from the Qu’Appelle River gets pushed into it. “We expect it will go above that spring peak over the next several days, possibly by as much as 0.1 or 0.2 metres,” said Hjertaas.

McKay noted that levels in the Qu’Appelle watershed are reaffecting some properties already hit. “It’s been devastating to people trying to protect those structures, that in many cases have seen repairs take place,” he said. “I think the reflooding is having a tremendous impact on the people and their morale and ability to carry on this fight.”

Echo and Pasqua Lakes are up modestly, while Mission and Katepwa are receding. “They had risen quite a bit.” Crooked also began receding after peaking Saturday — even higher than spring’s levels. Round Lake was still rising, and was expected to peak Monday.

McKay said sandbags in some areas of the Qu’Appelle Valley will likely remain for the next few weeks — just in case.

“People are a little bit worried about upcoming events, rain storms and so on that might raise lake levels again.”

In the north, work also continued in the Cumberland House area in preparation for high water flows through the community. It’s expected to peak around July 1, with the water rising about a half metre higher than flooding in 2005. Access roads remain open. Helicopters are on standby for medical evacuations if necessary.

SaskEnergy’s Dave Burdeniuk said service had been restored to much of the Willow Park Green trailer court in Estevan. Some customers around Roche Percee remained without service, as did some in isolated situations across the province in which customers’ basements had been flooded, he said.

SaskPower’s James Parker said about 100 customers remained disconnected in the southeast part of the province due to flooding. Service was expected to be restored to those customers when possible over the next week, he said.",2014-05-04T04:51:37.636120,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Estevan', 'streetAddress': '802 6th St', 'postalCode': 'S4A', 'formattedAddress': '802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada'}, 'coords': [-102.986111, 49.139167]}",SO3u6NLOQPG9r6xCNSxiXw,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-06-26T18:56:00.000Z,14521-312,ushahidi,The ups and downs of Saskatchewan flooding woes,"[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:07:55.621338,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Estevan,"802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada",S4A,802 6th St,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Estevan', 'streetAddress': '802 6th St', 'postalCode': 'S4A', 'formattedAddress': '802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada'}","[-102.986111, 49.139167]",49.139167,-102.986111,Flood Hazards,,,en

2014-05-09 19:07:56.361369,"To see just how far the flooding in southeastern Saskatchewan has extended, one needs to look no further than the towns of Benson and Lampman.

Neither town is near a major body of water. Neither had significant rain over the past week. And yet one is using an army of pumper trucks to push water past it and the other is protecting itself with an 243-metre long, three-metre high dike.

The crush of water heading toward southwestern Manitoba is also hurtling faster than first thought.

The Souris River will peak between July 7 and 9 at Wawanesa, Man., provincial officials said Thursday at a flood briefing.

That's about 10 days earlier than the province predicted only on Wednesday, leaving communities along the river's path only about two weeks to raise dikes by as much as 2.2 metres.

Minot is the state's fourth largest city with a population of 41,000. On Wednesday, when the emergency sirens sounded, 11,000 of the residents were ordered to evacuate the river valley.

2014-05-09 19:07:57.002723,"The stressful year for those living in the River Park and Churchhill Park neighbourhoods continued this week as the Moose Jaw River started to rise again and they were forced to protect their properties for the second time this year.

The City of Moose Jaw issued a flood watch on Thursday, but River Park resident Rick Klein says it had already started rising drastically by Tuesday.

""We knew with the Avonlea water coming, that it was going to be coming quick, and Monday I had a bit of a heads up that probably starting Tuesday or Wednesday the water was going to be coming up quite drastically.  We didn't know exact levels because we only have information a day and a half up stream.""

""It's been coming up probably an inch an hour for about the last sixty hours,"" adds Klein, who's home is right on the river's edge in River Park.

Klein has been unhappy with the slow reaction by the City to the rising water, ""This could have been prevented for sure, if they would have yanked the logs Monday morning and drained the creek again, it could have handled this four feet, but when the water's already at a nice level, and you put four feet on top of that, it can't handle it.""

He says it's become very stressful to continuingly maintain his yard with it flooding for the second time this year already, ""I just spent two months fixing my yard from last time, we weren't expecting this.  We're prepared, we covered what we could, but you can't prepare yourself for this.""

The flood watch remains in effect this weekend here in Moose Jaw.  Water levels peaked downstream and city officials say that the rise of the Moose Jaw River has started to slow through the Wakamow Valley.

Everyone is asked to stay off the river and away from the river banks due to the fast flows.

The severe flooding in other parts of Southern Saskatchewan is causing headaches for the province's oil and gas industry.  Saskatchewan Energy Minister Bill Boyd says companies can't drill when their leases are covered in nearly two metres of water.

He says at least 20,000 to 30,000 barrels of daily production have been shut in because of the one-in-500-year flooding event.

Boyd says it's tough to tell what the exact economic impact could be, but he says it could be hundreds of millions of dollars.",2014-05-04T04:51:45.787773,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Moose Jaw', 'streetAddress': '1057 Main St N', 'postalCode': 'S6H 0X2', 'formattedAddress': '1057 Main St N, Moose Jaw, SK S6H 0X2, Canada'}, 'coords': [-105.534447, 50.400053]}",IeCbagOvSOejUd_F2TVSfA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-06-25T08:06:00.000Z,14521-301,ushahidi,Concerns Over Flood Preparations In Moose Jaw,"[{'name': 'Damaged Property', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'High Water Levels', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:07:57.002723,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Moose Jaw,"1057 Main St N, Moose Jaw, SK S6H 0X2, Canada",S6H 0X2,1057 Main St N,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Moose Jaw', 'streetAddress': '1057 Main St N', 'postalCode': 'S6H 0X2', 'formattedAddress': '1057 Main St N, Moose Jaw, SK S6H 0X2, Canada'}","[-105.534447, 50.400053]",50.400053,-105.534447,Damaged Property,Flood Hazards,High Water Levels,en
2014-05-09 19:07:55.738918,"To see just how far the flooding in southeastern Saskatchewan has extended, one needs to look no further than the towns of Benson and Lampman.

Neither town is near a major body of water. Neither had significant rain over the past week. And yet one is using an army of pumper trucks to push water past it.

The other is protecting itself with an 800-foot long, 10-foot high dike.

The water is coming down a natural slope that runs from the northwest to the southeast. It starts off near Creelman Marsh and Fillmore Flats and, since the land to the southeast is still so saturated from the spring melt, the rainwater that fell to the west runs over it like a sheet of plastic.

""It doesn't seem like it rained very much and yet the water keeps rising. There's no river, no creek. There's nothing feeding this,"" said Lampman Mayor Scott Greening.

Through much of the day Wednesday and Thursday, Benson (located 40 kilometres north of Estevan) employed 52 pumper trucks from nearby oilfields to push water over Highway 47 and prevent it from rushing back into the hamlet.

Thirty kilometres to the southeast in Lampman, meanwhile, the town has constructed the massive dike because its storm sewer system runs out to the northwest, but the oncoming water would just push it back into town.

And while sandbags and dikes are diverting some of the water, Greening wants to see it move much faster. The land east of Lampman, however, is too flat for the water to flow quickly away.

""It's like tabletop - it takes so long for the water to go,"" Greening said.

All the excess water is causing problems across rural roads in the southeast, including Benson. It has become so bad in recent days and so many grid roads have water on them that Rural Municipality of Benson administrator Laureen Keating is fielding calls and consulting maps to help people find routes around the RM.

""We're almost to the point where there's no roads left,"" said Keating.

Elsewhere around the southeast, things were improving little by little after a second straight day without rain on Thursday.

As inflows to Rafferty and Boundary reservoirs decreased, outflows from their dams fell to a combined 490 cubic metres per second (cms) being sent down the Souris River.

While there is now room in the reservoirs to collect more water, it's too difficult to say how heavy a rain it can withstand before outflows need to be increased again. The Estevan area could see another 25 millimetres of rain today and Saturday.

The high outflows from the Souris have caused problems on several major highways in the Estevan area, including 18, 47 and 39.

It has also left many of the homes in the village of Roche Percee underwater and forced hundreds more from their homes in rural areas.

Some of those who had to be evacuated in Estevan got good news Thursday when the 500 residents of the Willow Park Greens Trailer Court were allowed back into their homes to stay for the first time since Sunday.

There was also good news for flooding victims in that the provincial government announced that for the second straight year, it would pay out $3,000 advances to those claiming flood damage through the Provincial Disaster Assistance Program (PDAP). Additional payments will go out to those whose applications are for more than $3,000. It is expected that the early payment cheques will be available within two weeks from filing.

During the labour dispute at Canada Post, PDAP applications are being accepted by email at pdapdocs@gov. sk.ca and fax at 798-2318, They can also be dropped off at claimants' rural municipality, town or village offices or their city hall. Claimants will be notified by a PDAP representative when they are approved for the early payment and provided with details of where and when to pick up cheques.

There are warnings, however, being issued again for residents further north along the Moose Jaw and Qu'Appelle river systems.

The recent rains are increasing flows along those systems and the river at Moose Jaw is expected to be 1.5 metres higher than it was earlier in the week.

Along the Qu'Appelle system and the lakes it goes through -including Katepwa, Pasqua, Echo and Crooked - the levels are expected to be close to or exceed levels reached this spring when several cottages were flooded.

The water in that area also left the Trans-Canada Highway between Balgonie and Whitewood closed for the third straight day.

2014-05-09 19:07:57.625758,"The mayor of a flood-ravaged Saskatchewan village says he and other residents evacuated from their homes earlier this week have been hit by looters.

""They're taking my stuff and destroying my stuff and my friends and neighbours' stuff,"" said Roche Percee Mayor Reg Jahn.

Most residents of the village of 150 in the southeast corner of the province had to be evacuated after heavy rains and the release of water from local dams sent a wall of water over dikes on Sunday morning.

The community is in a valley and some homes were left completely under water, but others located at a higher elevation stayed relatively dry.

Among those who had to leave was Jahn, but he returned in a boat on Wednesday to retrieve some family photographs and other personal items.

Once inside the house, it was clear that someone had gone from room to room, ransacking the cabinets and trashing the place, he said.

A small safe that contained papers and some jewelry had been chiseled open and items were stolen, he said.

""I know my wife was totally devastated,"" he said. ""It's a bad, bad feeling — kick you when you're down, eh?""

Jahn said he later learned that other residents have had their homes looted since the flood.

In one case, someone entered a house through a skylight and made off with a wide-screen TV.

""I don't know what I would do if I were to catch them,"" he said. ""I believe myself to be a pretty forgiving person, but…""

People have been so busy just keeping ahead of the rising water, they haven't had time to tally up everything that has been taken, he said.

Jahn said what's needed is someone to provide more security, as is the case in the U.S. where the National Guard watches over homes in flood zones.

2014-05-09 19:07:56.704316,"The Saskatchewan Watershed Authority is reporting there will be no changes in outflow from the Rafferty and Boundary Dam Reservoirs today.

In the provincial government’s daily flood conference call, Dale Hjertaas of the SWA said the reservoirs are declining slowly and the outflows will remain at 490 cubic metres per second. Hjertaas said there will likely be a reduction on Saturday but did not indicate how much that might be.

Hjertaas said there remains a serious risk to the Town of Lampman but noted town employees and volunteers have been hard at work shoring up the dikes and sandbagging in the area to stop the water.

Parts of Benson have been flooded forcing the evacuation of some residents. Teams of volunteers remain on the scene working to limit the damage to homes in the Hamlet.

Other notes from the call:

• The evacuation shelter in Estevan is largely empty now that the evacuation has been lifted at Willow Park Greens. However, the shelter, which is now located at the Civic Auditorium, will remain open and is still registering people from Benson and Roche Percee. There are also some food services being provided at the shelter.

“We are responding to calls for assistance from those communities and giving them a warm shoulder to cry on and we are helping them make referrals to some of the other resources we need,” said Norm Vetter of the Ministry of Social Services.

As well, 63 people sought information at the Estevan Recovery Centre at St. Joseph’s Hospital, 47 of whom have been displaced from their homes.

• Roads remains a concern in the area. Highway 47 south will remain closed with sections of the pavement near the bridge over the Souris River washed out.

• Traffic on Highway 39 south of Estevan is still down to one lane for light vehicles only. Also, a hole developed in the road at the abutment to the bridge near Roche Percee. Crews filled the hole with large rock which should prevent further erosion to the abutment.

• Getting coal to the Boundary Dam Power Station remains an issue. They are now able to access a coal pit near the power plant and expect to get 6,000 tonnes of coal into Boundary today which will allow them to produce 350 to 400 megawatts of electricity, roughly half of the plant’s capacity.

James Parker of SaskPower said it could be months before the coal haul road, which is currently flooded, is usable again.

“It will be out of action for some time which constrains our ability to get coal to the plant so we will not be at full capacity at Boundary Dam for a number of weeks into the future,” said Parker who added they are working to reinforce the Rafferty Dam road to allow them to truck in supplies to the plant.

The City of Estevan also issued its daily report:

The Reception Centre has been moved to the Civic Auditorium and continues to host evacuees from the Hamlet of Benson and the Village of Roche Percee.  They will continue to accept evacuees and the contact number will remain as 634-1876.  Counselling will be available at the Estevan Recovery Service Centre at St. Joseph's Hospital.  The Souris Valley Aquatic and Leisure Centre has reopened to the public.

The Estevan Recovery Service Centre at St. Joseph's Hospital is available for flood and water damage victims including seepage issues.  Numerous provincial and local agencies will be in attendance to offer assistance regarding the local water issues.  The Service Centre will be open every day until June 29, 2011 from 11 a.m. until 8 p.m.  Please use the South East entrance (long term care entrance).

Residents travelling are encouraged to contact the Highway Hotline before travelling. 

• Highway 39 East is down to one lane with heavy load restrictions

• Highway 47 North continues to be down to one lane

• Highway 39 West has water flowing over at Macoun with the Department of Highways assisting traffic. 

• City of Estevan Humane Society access road is open but use caution. 

• Highway 18 West and Highway 47 South remain closed.  These two highways are extremely dangerous at this time due to the washout below the asphalt surface.  Rafferty Dam Road continues to be used for local traffic only

Estevan Police Service and Estevan Fire and Rescue Service require residents to stay away from affected areas.  Anyone caught disobeying barricades or road closures will be charged. 

Residents are reminded that floodwaters are extremely dangerous.  Floating debris and other water hazards above and beneath the surface are dangerous for all watercraft.  All power lines are energized and should be considered dangerous.  At the moment, power lines are close to the surface so watercraft could come into contact with energized lines. Rescues are extremely dangerous for Fire and Rescue Services personnel.

The Water Treatment Plant is fully operational. The City Landfill is open and accessible by the north road only.

The City of North Battleford has a mutual aid agreement with Weyburn, among other Saskatchewan cities, to provide assistance in the event of a disaster. Following a request from that city for assistance, specifically personnel capable of managing emergency operations, Tomaz was dispatched to lend a hand in the emergency operations center. 

Weyburn declared a state of emergency after receiving more than 60 millimeters of rain, leading to an electrical failure and effluent overflow at the city’s sewage lift station. Firefighters in Weyburn rescued dozens of people from flooded mobile homes Saturday. The city also received assistance in the form of portable pumps from Regina. 

“We understand what it is like to be a city in crisis,” said Fire Chief Pat MacIssac.

2014-05-09 19:07:57.539639,"Canadian Pacific Railway has shut a key cross-border track for up to 10 days because of flooding in Saskatchewan and North Dakota, dashing its hopes of putting a recent deluge of bad weather behind it.

The company said Thursday the rapidly rising Souris River forced the shutdown on Monday night of a line running between southern Saskatchewan and the U.S. Midwest, one of three heavily used CP freight arteries into the United States.

The news comes a week after CP, Canada's second biggest railway, said this year's spate of service disruptions due to heavy snow and then flooding looked to be over and that it was working to earn back customer confidence.

""Just when much of the investment community and CP thought we were seeing greener pastures ahead, we have more challenges,"" said Raymond James analyst Steve Hansen.

""It's not anything that CP's doing wrong, per se. It's just really a matter of Mother Nature hitting hard where CP has its tracks located,"" he said.

CP's shares are down 10 per cent this year, in part because of a bigger than expected twothirds slump in profit in the first-quarter when avalanches and heavy snow in Western Canada forced it to close tracks.

As winter turned to spring, flooding along Manitoba's Red River in April compelled the railroad to close tracks in that province and reroute trains.

In this week's closure, caused by heavy rains in southern Saskatchewan, CP is re-routing traffic through Winnipeg, on its own tracks to Glenwood, Minn., company spokesman Mike LoVecchio said.

Delays for shippers were less than 24 hours, he said.

""We were able to evacuate all rail traffic so there are no stranded shipments,"" LoVecchio said of the track that handles all types of freight, including grain, coal, intermodal and merchandise shipments.

CP would normally use other companies' tracks in the flood-hit area, but they are also being affected by high water levels, LoVecchio said.

2014-05-09 19:07:57.803115,"SaskEnergy is planning to examine its system of gas lines in flood-ravaged areas of Saskatchewan after it called in police divers from Regina to shut off groundlevel valves that are now under 10 feet of water.

The provincial utility said it's unclear whether the current or debris from the flood waters damaged equipment or washed away ground that was covering lines. An evaluation of its system is being planned for when waters recede, SaskEnergy said Thursday.

On Tuesday, four members of the Regina Police Service Underwater Investigation and Recovery Team, normally called for drownings, accidents and other emergencies, helped with the unique operation of closing valves on gas lines serving areas south of Estevan. While service had been shut off to customers, officials wanted the lines at the regulator station closed as a precaution, especially since the small collection of lines and valves that poke out of the ground were never meant to be underwater.

""It's not designed to be submersible and our staff has never had a need to go underwater before,"" said SaskEnergy spokesman Dave Burdeniuk, adding the water is too deep for its staff. ""If it were a matter where one of our technicians could have waded in up to his waist or chest, so he could just lean over and shut it off, we might have done that. But because it's totally submerged, that wasn't an option.""

Dive team leader Const. Colin Magee admitted he had mixed feelings about the mission because it was unique, as well as difficult because of the massive amount of damage to homes and businesses.

""This was right up our alley in terms of what our diving team can do,"" Magee said Thursday. ""But my heart goes out to the residents there. The amount of water there is horrific. We were launching our boat in the ditch. And it's not every day you're driving across someone's front yard in a boat.""

Tuesday's mission began with an explanation of the task, which was to send a diver to unlock a box before turning seven valves normally used to regulate gas pressure. With help from Estevan fire and police services, as well as local paramedics, divers Corp. Todd Sherwin and Const. Craig Solomon dove into the area and completed the mission quickly. They even met new friends inside the locked cabinet.

""As soon as Craig opened the door, all of these fish swam out - that was something we've never seen before,"" said Magee.

The team was lucky because the water wasn't as murky as they expected, so Sherwin and Solomon were able to see what they were doing. Pictures of the station provided by SaskEnergy helped, Magee added.

""That was immensely helpful because our divers were able to follow the right pipes and the right shut-off valves,"" said Magee, who works in the police service's policy department when he isn't working with the team. ""To do that in the dark, and try to work from your memory of a picture, would have been more difficult and would have taken much longer.""

Magee said the mission was simple but it also came with dangers because of the potential debris carried by the water and underwater visibility was limited to just a few feet.

""Just because your neighbour went diving in Mexico, it doesn't mean he can do this,"" said Magee, adding his team is prepared for everything from dangerous currents, zero visibility and extreme temperatures. ""It was kind of bizarre working in the boat while watching horses walk by in the distance.""

The cost of the mission, which is has yet to be tabulated, is being picked up by SaskEnergy.",2014-05-04T04:51:57.597195,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Estevan', 'streetAddress': '802 6th St', 'postalCode': 'S4A', 'formattedAddress': '802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada'}, 'coords': [-102.986111, 49.139167]}",ov6YrZ4RSPqDZTYhy1aVwQ,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-06-24T02:16:00.000Z,14521-306,ushahidi,Gas lines to be inspected after floods,"[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:07:57.803115,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Estevan,"802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada",S4A,802 6th St,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Estevan', 'streetAddress': '802 6th St', 'postalCode': 'S4A', 'formattedAddress': '802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada'}","[-102.986111, 49.139167]",49.139167,-102.986111,Flood Hazards,,,en
2014-05-09 19:07:58.089037,"The Souris River is normally about 18 metres wide as it winds through this village in the southeastern corner of Saskatchewan. But these days, it has spilled its bank and is more than half a kilometre wide, virtually submerging the lower portion of the community and forcing just about the entire population of 200 to flee.

In a boat tour of their hometown, Reg and Harley Jahn point out dozens of places they grew up around while ferrying two visitors up and down the streets of their town by boat.

In some places the water is believed to be as much as 22 feet deep, but the depth finder on Harley's boat reads seven feet through most of the town. Floating up Main Street, the boat passes homes where the water is nearly up to their eaves.

""These people just bought that house for $250,000,"" the Jahns say passing one roof sticking out of the water.

""That woman there works four jobs and now she's lost everything,"" they say pointing out another.

At times they're able to share a laugh, like pointing to the not-quite-yet soaked sign in the window of the town hall offering flood information. ""If I don't laugh, I'll cry,"" says Reg.

Having spent most of their 60-plus years in Roche Percee, the brothers know every corner of the village, but never — even after the legendary flood of 1969 — have they seen so much of it disappear underwater.

As the boat trolls along, Harley has to dodge the top bar of a park's swing set that is barely visible above water and he is constantly mindful of the street signs poking out above the current.

Many other towns and rural municipalities in southeast Saskatchewan have been battling high water due to rain — close to 150 millimetres in some areas — and the unprecedented releases into the Souris from the Rafferty, Boundary and Alameda dams. None, however, have disappeared quite like Roche Percee.

Only a handful of its 200 residents are still in their homes — those who live farther up the valley wall.

Earlier in the week, Reg was confident that most people would eventually return to their homes in the village once the water subsided and start over. Now, even as the sun shone on Wednesday and releases from the dams decreased, he's not so sure.

""(Tuesday) I think was the breaking point,"" he says.

2014-05-09 19:07:57.120090,"More Saskatchewan communities are declaring flood emergencies, with people in Wolseley the latest to be sent scrambling by rising water.

Plea for aid
The Red Cross issued an urgent plea Wednesday for donations of cash and other items for people in Saskatchewan displaced by the recent wave of natural disasters.

The aid organization said almost 2,000 people have registered for flood relief in the province, mostly from the inundated southern region.

""They may have got out without their clothes or a toothbrush, that kind of thing, so Red Cross is helping out with that,"" said Candace Lamb, a staff member at the Red Cross's Saskatchewan office. ""And then as the waters recede, Red Cross's role would become helping out as people are getting back into their homes and recovering, and seeing what they need.""

The Red Cross said even the smallest donation can make a big difference.

Canadian Blood Services also appealed for help Wednesday. Flooding has shut down blood donor clinics in Weyburn and Estevan, so people in Regina are being asked to roll up their sleeves to make up the shortfall.

According to provincial officials, 26 communities had made local declarations as of Wednesday, up from 18 on Friday.

Following weeks of rain, hundreds of people in the southeast part of the province have been displaced from their homes — for a few days in some cases, but for longer in others.

In recent days, Weyburn, Yellow Grass, Radville and the Estevan area have all been hit by flash floods.

In Wolseley, a town of 780 about 100 kilometres east of Regina, at least 50 people were out of their homes Wednesday morning because of rising water.

Some basements are full of water and some bridges around the town are closed.

Carrie Churchman, who packed up her two children and went to her parents' farm, said there was water in her basement and all around her house.

""I hate it,"" she said. ""I look at my house and … how did it happen?""

Churchman said she may not be able to move back in for a few days.

2014-05-09 19:07:57.895672,"Water levels from the Souris River are slowly starting to decrease in the Estevan area.

Rafferty Dam was at 450 cubic metres per second (m3/s) as of mid-morning on Wednesday, which was down from 508 m3/s on Tuesday. Rafferty was three-tenths of a metre, or a foot, beneath its maximum flood level.

Boundary Dam was increased from 210 m3/s to 260 m3/s on Tuesday afternoon, and it remained at that level on Wednesday morning. Another 11 m3/s was being diverted from Boundary to Rafferty.

Total releases into the Souris River were 710 m3/s on Wednesday morning, which was down from the 770 m3/s peak level observed on Tuesday.

Dale Hjertaas, the executive director of policy and communications at the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority (SWA), said that the southeast didn't receive as much rain as expected, or feared, on Tuesday. But he didn't say that the worst had passed, either, as future rain events could force water releases to increase again.

While Boundary Dam is still above the maximum flood level, the inflows peaked on Tuesday, and are now starting to wane.

""If it doesn't rain again in the next couple of days, then the peak flows will have passed,"" said Hjertaas.

Flows are still ""incredibly"" high, he said, but they aren't as severe as they were on Tuesday, when records were shattered. The water is slowly receding, he said, even if it might be hard to notice.

No structural damage has occurred at Rafferty Dam in the last few weeks, he said, and water never breached the top of the dam. The maximum allowable flood level is a metre-and-a-half beneath the top of the dam.

Several highways remain closed due to flooding, and now Highway 39 in the Roche Percee Valley is down to one lane of traffic. Some water has spilled onto the road. Motorists are asked to be prepared to stop.

The closed highways include: Highway 47 from the U.S. border to the junction with Highway 18; Highway 18 from the junction with Highway 47 to the junction with Highway 350; Highway 350 from Highway 18 to the junction with the U.S. border, and Highway 9 from the U.S. border to the junction with Highway

A recovery service centre for victims of flooding and water damage will be set up at St. Joseph’s Hospital Auditorium, starting on Thursday at 11 a.m. Numerous provincial and local agencies will be in attendance to offer assistance regarding the local flooding situation. 

A total of 261 families have been registered at a reception centre at the Souris Valley Aquatic and Leisure Centre. Included in that total are 533 adults and 130 children. Twelve families are staying in hotels, and 25 are in shelters.

A large amount of donations have been provided for victims of the flooding.

A berm in Willow Park Greens was successfully reinforced yesterday and the water pumps are no longer required.  The Estevan Police Service has confirmed that there haven't been reports of looting or vandalism at the trailer park.

North Dakota is now feeling the affects of the flooding since the Souris River winds its way south of the border.  About 11,000 people in Minot are being told to evacuate, nearly a quarter of the cities population. Experts are calling this the worst flooding in forty years for Moose Jaw's Sister City.

As residents of the southeast attempt to hold back the flood waters, scam artists are now picking on the flood ravaged areas. Weyburn Police Inspector Russ Chartrand tells us a scam has surfaced in the last couple days. ""We recently had some reports of individuals who are going door-to-door soliciting funds from individuals and suggesting that they're with flood relief. To our knowledge, there are no legitimate flood relief people out there soliciting funds."" 

That said, Chartrand is also extending a big thank you to everyone that has offered their assistance with the flood efforts from outside of the community, he says it's unfortunate that people sometimes choose to prey on the generosity of citizens.

The only positive news today when it comes to the flooding is the fact that Environment Canada was way off the mark with their rainfall predictions Tuesday.

2014-05-09 19:07:57.994331,"A fifth day of rain brought more misery to flooded communities in southeastern Saskatchewan and threatened even bigger problems downstream on the swollen Souris River.

Grey clouds hovered over the city of Estevan, which was expected to get up to 30 millimetres of rain Tuesday. That's on top of the 287 mm that has fallen on the city since May 1 -- making this the wettest May-June period since recording began in 1945.

""Every time you look out and it's raining, it makes you a little bit sick,"" said Estevan Mayor Gary St. Onge.

Estevan was one of 24 communities under a state of emergency Tuesday -- up four from Monday.

To make matters worse, the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority said Tuesday that it has to release more water from dams in the region because the reservoirs are full.

""Essentially, the system is just absolutely saturated from starting with spring runoff and then just rain event after rain event,"" said authority spokesman Dale Hjertaas.

""Everything is full. The river channels are full, the sloughs are full and now the reservoir capacity is full as well. Each time it rains, more of the water is moving on downstream and producing flows that none of us has seen before.""

Emergency Social Services in Saskatchewan estimates that nearly 800 people have been forced from their homes across the region. Officials said the exact number is hard to pinpoint because many evacuees are staying with family or friends, not in shelters.
Rainfall amounts in Saskatchewan are being assessed to provide a revised forecast for the Souris River in Manitoba. Manitoba Water Stewardship is working closely with the U.S. National Weather Service and the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority on the issue.
Preliminary forecasts have the Souris cresting in mid-July near the spring peak level and remaining there for an extended period. Precipitation in the next three weeks will be critical.
The situation is worse downstream in Minot, N.D., where the Souris is set to overtop levees and swamp thousands of homes and businesses. Some 10,000 residents have been ordered to leave their homes -- about a quarter of the city's population.
Water is expected to reach the top of levees within two days and the flooding is expected to dwarf the historic flood of 1969, when the Souris River reached 1,554.5 feet above sea level.
Mayor Curt Zimbelman said the river at the city's Broadway Bridge was just a tenth of an inch shy of that level Tuesday afternoon, and it's expected to hit nearly 1,563 feet this weekend.

There are international agreements in place to make sure water released from dams doesn't harm anyone downstream, including in Manitoba, where the Souris eventually loops around and joins the Assiniboine River.

Hjertaas said Saskatchewan can't do anything to hold back the flow.

""The storage capacity in the dams has been used and so there is not capacity to reduce the impact on Minot,"" said Hjertaas.

2014-05-09 19:07:56.805052,"All the excess water running down the Souris River and causing problems in Saskatchewan is about to do the same farther downstream.

The city of Minot, N.D., is preparing for the rush of water by evacuating between 10,000 and 11,000 people - a quarter of Minot's population - from homes near the river by 6 p.m. today.

The high water on the Souris is expected to hit anytime after that.

""Some people have been prepared, but never did we think we were going to get this much water down from Canada,"" said Dean Lenertz, a captain with the Minot Fire Department. ""They're frustrated that we're going to move out and that we're going to have probably our record flood of all time.""

According to Lenertz, the water level in Minot is expected to be seven to eight feet higher than it was during the community's 1969 flood which saw several houses completely underwater.

The events of that year didn't make residents shy away from living on the river. In fact, two new developments went up near the Souris after Rafferty and Alameda dams were completed in Saskatchewan in 1995 to help minimize flooding along the Souris.

With recent rainfalls totalling close to 150 millimetres in southeastern Saskatchewan, reservoirs on those two dams, as well as Boundary Dam are full, forcing Saskatchewan Watershed Authority officials to release water at a record pace.

""(North Dakota officials) have expressed appreciation through this long spring of trying to keep the flows down,"" said the watershed authority's Dale Hjertaas, noting that he and his colleagues are in touch with their counterparts in North Dakota and Manitoba at least once a day. ""They understand the situation that when a dam is full, it's full. They're hoping we can do whatever we can to help them out, but they understand that one can only do what the dam is designed to do.""

Two shelters have been set up in Minot with more to come as needed. Most evacuees - some of whom were forced out earlier this month for what proved to be a false alarm - have found places to stay with family, said Lenertz. Dikes are being built around the city's main roads and other infrastructure including pumping and sewer stations, schools and city hall.

Premier Brad Wall discussed the situation Monday with North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple.

""They're a bit, as we are, not very excited about the amount of release that we're having to let out to protect the dams but I think they understand that that release is important to preserve the integrity of our water management and prevent what would be much worse if (the dams) didn't exist at all or if something happened to them,"" said Wall.

Once the water passes through Minot it will head north to Manitoba, where the Souris eventually joins the Assiniboine River, and will enter an area that has battled flooding all spring.

Steve Topping, executive director of Manitoba's Department of Water Stewardship, said his department is closely monitoring the situation on the Souris and several other waterways making their way into the province from Saskatchewan.

While Topping is hoping some of the Souris spills out into wildlife refuges in North Dakota, the water could threaten communities like Souris, Melita and Wawanesa - all of which have already faced flooding this spring.

Flood protection barriers erected earlier this year have remained up, but may have to be reinforced, said Topping.

""We're lucky to get 20 cubic feet per second in the summer, but this year the Souris has contributed a huge volume to the Assiniboine River and Lake Manitoba,"" said Topping.",2014-05-04T04:51:52.873294,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Enniskillen No 3', 'postalCode': 'S0C', 'formattedAddress': 'Enniskillen No 3, SK, Canada'}, 'coords': [-102.267586, 49.08335]}",GWT36moHT-Gi3PH5HodeaQ,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-06-22T02:12:00.000Z,14521-287,ushahidi,Over 10000 out of homes,"[{'name': 'Evacuations', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'High Water Levels', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:07:56.805052,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Enniskillen No 3,"Enniskillen No 3, SK, Canada",S0C,,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Enniskillen No 3', 'postalCode': 'S0C', 'formattedAddress': 'Enniskillen No 3, SK, Canada'}","[-102.267586, 49.08335]",49.08335,-102.267586,Evacuations,Flood Hazards,High Water Levels,en
2014-05-09 19:07:58.189434,"Saskatoon is a bit soggy after recent rainfalls.

Environment Canada issued a rainfall warning for the city of Saskatoon on Tuesday afternoon, with up to 50 millimetres of rain predicted locally, caused by a slow-moving trough of low pressure over southern Saskatchewan.

Showers and thunderstorms began at about noon and continued into the afternoon.

About 39 mm of rain was recorded at the Saskatoon airport and the intersection of 51st Street and Millar Avenue was washed out briefly around noon Tuesday. The flooding lasted about 15 minutes, said Galen Heinrichs, water and sewer engineering manager for the City of Saskatoon.

""From what I can observe right now, it looks like this has passed,"" Heinrichs said late Tuesday afternoon, noting most of the rain fell in the north end of the city.

Rainfall warnings also extended around the city Tuesday, including the communities of Martensville, Warman, Rosthern, Delisle and Wakaw, with up to 50 mm of rain predicted for these areas.

South of the city, the communities of Outlook, Watrous, Hanley, Imperial and Dinsmore were under the same warning. To the north, the communities of Prince Albert, Shellbrook, Spiritwood, Duck Lake, Meadow Lake, Big River, Green Lake and Pierceland were also under a rainfall warning for much of the afternoon.

Environment Canada reported scattered thunderstorms created heavy downpours in localized areas. Elstow, about 51 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon, reported 42.9 mm of rain during a two-hour period Tuesday.

Showers were expected to weaken into the evening with improved conditions Wednesday.

Last year, the city experienced as much as 85 mm of rain in one hour. In 2007 there were rainfalls of more than 100 mm in an hour.

""This isn't quite on the same level as the storms we had last year,"" Heinrichs said.

The most recent advisory posted by the Meewasin Valley Authority urges Saskatoon residents to be cautious around the river as flows increase through the city. Riverbanks are unstable and many areas have steep drop-offs.

Many low-lying areas, including public facilities and trails have flooded or are expected to flood.

Public sites that have flooded or are expected to flood include the Fred Heal canoe launch and all beaches.

Today more rain pounded the city, leaving residents coping with rising water levels.

But as Global News learned, the rushing water isn’t dampening community spirit.

“This is Saskatchewan,” said volunteer Cole Goertz.

“There are a lot of people in need here, a lot of people who can use any kind of volunteering or any kind of help we could possibly give them. So myself, and two busloads of people, we all saw the opportunity and jumped at it.”

Goertz was just one of 80 volunteers who came down from the Queen City to lend a helping hand.

The government employees ditched their suits and ties for rubber boots, and got hard to work.

“I’m really happy to come out here and do this,” said Goertz.

“Anytime we’re able to come out of the buildings in Regina and come into the communities and help out where we can is always a great experience.”

The assistance isn’t just coming from the outside.

Within Weyburn, the community has set up the Recovery Center.

The site is a place offering support for flood victims.

“It’s a place that people can come get all the info they need in order to start recovering from the events that are taking place,” said Recover Center organizer Mieka Torgrimson.

Events meaning extreme rainfall.

The area has seem over 120mm of precipitation since last Thursday.

Meaning there’s significant damage to city roads, and people’s houses.

But even those seeking help are thinking more about others.

2014-05-09 19:07:58.980781,"It ain't over till it's over. 

That memorable line uttered by Yogi Berra about a baseball game could very well translate into a comment on flood conditions that are wreaking havoc in southeast Saskatchewan.

Flood waters will probably continue to race through Estevan, Roche Percee and the RM of Estevan for a few more days, testing the will and patience of hundreds of area residents who have been displaced by the prevailing sogginess.

According to Dale Hjertaas, executive director of policy and communications for the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority, the total volume of water being released from Rafferty and Boundary Dam reservoirs and running into the Souris River and onto low-lying land in and around Estevan and the RM of Estevan, is 555 to 750 cubic metres per second. That peak flow isn't expected to subside either, at least not for a few more days. 

As of Monday morning, the release flow rate from Rafferty was 425 cubic metres per second while it was 130 at Boundary Dam. 

""Further rain overnight on Sunday prompted the Monday hike,"" said Hjertaas, since there was no storage capacity left at either of these two dams. 

Referring to the situation as a ""major flood condition,"" Hjertaas said the Authority was continually monitoring the inflow to Boundary from Long Creek which may prompt a further increase from that reservoir. 

The authority started releasing the current peak flow Sunday afternoon (June 19) to accommodate the additional flows upstream due to recent heavy rains that also caused major problems in communities such as Yellow Grass and Weyburn where nearby Nickle Lake had peaked to its full level. 

All this means that water levels around the RM of Estevan and some city areas could rise as much as another half metre before they begin to subside. And if rains come again within the next few days, then all bets are off and the water control experts head back to their drawing boards and calculators. 

Things are a little less desperate at the Alameda Dam where water release had to be upped from 27 cubic metres per second to 50 on Monday, again, to accommodate the rain in an already full reservoir. 

""We want to get some space in those reservoirs,"" said Hjertaas, referring to Boundary and Rafferty. That would mean a continuation of the extremely high flow rate in an attempt to lower the levels by even a few centimetres. 

""So you'll be seeing some continuing high flows for a few more days and we review it every day ... every hour ... expect 555 cubic metres for a few days, there's still a lot of water coming through the system,"" Hjertaas said. 

Hjertaas said that this almost worst case scenario came about due to the ""third or fourth major rain event we've had since the reservoirs filled. The ground was already saturated, the capacity of the reservoirs is limited, so the water has to be passed through."" 

The Watershed Authority executive added that ""Rafferty was built for a one in 100 year flood crisis, and this is it."" 

Without the dams, the flow through the local valley with each episode would have been about 700 cubic metres per second, or another half metre in depth over what is already being experienced.

""Our daily information sharing with the downstream recipients such as the city of Minot, informs us they are coping, but with this now ... it's going to be a large flood at Minot,"" Hjertaas said. 

As far as dam integrity is concerned, Hjertaas assured the media that the dam structures are holding up well, they are not being breached and rumours of them having to truck in clay products to buttress a failing structure just weren't true. 

""Someone may have seen trucks with material in them heading out to the region, but that would probably be for dike building in Roche Percee or somewhere in the RM,"" he said.

2014-05-09 19:07:59.277076,"Some neighbourhoods in Regina are faring better than others following three days of heavy rain. Meanwhile the city insists much of the circumstances are simply out of its hands.

Brian Miller, Regina’s sewer and drainage operations manager, says the city’s drainage system is simply at capacity.

Too much water caused by heavy rain, means the sewer system can't handle all the volume. As a result, it takes a few hours after the rain ends for the water to drain away and the streets to empty.

Miller points out that new areas have retention ponds and other mitigating efforts in place. There's also a long-term plan to help out older areas.

""There's a lot of work identified on there that the city is progressively working at to make these improvements in different parts of the city,"" said Miller.

However, when asked for a timeline, Miller simply stated that the work was ""progressive"" in nature and being done when it could be.

Part of that effort is happening on Victoria Avenue East. Work crews have been trying to dig a massive flood water retention area over the last few weeks but progress has been significantly hampered by the rain.

Miller says people seeing flooding on their streets will have to be patient, insisting that the water will clear out eventually. He advises people to protect their homes by ensuring downspouts drain out onto the street.

Water is expected to rise somewhat along Wascana Creek now that a weir has been lifted from the Albert Street Bridge at the request of the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority.
Miller doesn't expect water levels to get so high that the city will have to resort to sandbagging as it did during the peak flow levels seen earlier this spring.

2014-05-09 19:07:59.090875,"The Saskatchewan Watershed Authority (SWA) has increased the combined water release from Boundary Dam and Rafferty Dam Reservoirs to 720 cubic metres per second (m3/s). The possibility of additional increases remains.

Releases from Rafferty Dam have remained stable today at 500 m3/s today, said Dale Hjertaas, the executive director for policy and communications with the SWA. But the releases from Boundary Dam were ratcheted up from 160 m3/s to 220 m3/s on Tuesday morning. An additional increase to 260 m3/s could occur.

""There's still more rain in the forecast, so we're watching closely,"" said Hjertaas.

The flows through Estevan is another new local record, Hjertaas said.

""The system is just absolutely saturated, starting with spring run-off, and then just having rain event after rain event,"" said Hjertaas. ""So what's happening is each new rain finds it even more saturated, and an even greater portion of the water runs off into the system. Everything is full.""

Outflows at the Alameda Dam have been increased from 27 to 50 m3/s.

Several highways are closed in the region. Highway 9 from the U.S. border to the junction with Highway 18 became the latest to be closed this morning.

Highway 47 from Estevan to the U.S. border was shut down early on Monday morning. Highway 18 from Estevan to the junction with Highway 350 is closed. And Highway 350 from the junction with Highway 18 to the U.S. border is also shut down. The Rafferty Dam access road is open only for SaskPower employees.

As of Tuesday afternoon at 1 p.m., Highway 39 was still open between Estevan and North Portal. Some bridge expansion joint work was taking place. But there was a risk that a segment of the highway through the Roche Percee Valley could be closed due to increasing outflows.

The City of Estevan is warning residents should be aware that the flood waters are extremely dangerous. Floating debris and other water hazards above and beneath the surface pose a risk for all watercraft. All power lines are energized and should be considered dangerous. At the moment, power lines are very close to the water surface so watercraft could come into contact with energized lines. Chances of rescue are minimal.

The City of Estevan continues to pump water out of the Willow Park Greens Trailer Park. SaskPower has reinstated the power to the trailer park, however it will remain evacuated.

The Estevan Police Service has advised that there have not been any reports of looting for vandalism at this point at the trailer park.

Currently the evacuation centre has registered 203 families from Estevan and 31 families from Roche Percee. The facility is receiving donations of goods, which are greatly appreciated. 

The Leisure Centre will remain closed to the public until further notice.

The Water Treatment Plant is fully operational and there has not been a boil water advisory issued. The City Landfill is open and accessible. 

David Hickie is among the evacuated residents of the Willow Park Greens Trailer Park. He said that he was informed Sunday night at around 11:45 p.m. that he and other residents would be forced to flee.

""They came by in person … knocked on the door and said this is your evacuation notice,"" said Hickie. ""The water is the next row of trailers over. You have to leave.""

Hickie said he had a couple of packed bags waiting in his vehicle in case he would be evacuated.

He admitted that there was some frustration from residents that they were forced to leave in the middle of the night. As it turned out, he felt that the evacuation could have waited until Monday morning.

Food and information have been provided at the shelter. Hickie hasn't been staying at the shelter, but about 40 people have been sleeping at the Leisure Centre. 

Evacuees are waiting and nervous, Hickie said. They want to be able to return home, but they are also concerned that their homes could be flooded. They also want to know why there weren't additional water releases earlier this spring, and they wonder why a two-foot or a three-foot berm wasn't built around the trailer park.",2014-05-04T04:52:15.199581,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Cambria No 6', 'postalCode': 'S0C', 'formattedAddress': 'Cambria No 6, SK S0C, Canada'}, 'coords': [-103.250938, 49.150066]}",LqWEC6PFRnGlKMSr1THxog,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-06-21T16:20:00.000Z,14521-288,ushahidi,Outflows increase to 720 cubic metres per second,"[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'High Water Levels', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:07:59.090875,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Cambria No 6,"Cambria No 6, SK S0C, Canada",S0C,,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Cambria No 6', 'postalCode': 'S0C', 'formattedAddress': 'Cambria No 6, SK S0C, Canada'}","[-103.250938, 49.150066]",49.150066,-103.250938,Flood Hazards,High Water Levels,,en
2014-05-09 19:07:58.875396,"A fifth day of rain brought more misery to flooded communities in southeastern Saskatchewan and threatened even bigger problems downstream on the swollen Souris River.

Grey clouds hovered over the City of Estevan, which was expected to get up to 30 millimetres of rain Tuesday. That's on top of the 287 millimetres that has fallen on the city since May 1 — making this the wettest May-June period since records began in 1945.
""Every time you look out and it's raining, it's makes you a little bit sick,"" said Estevan Mayor Gary St. Onge.

Estevan was one of 24 communities under a state of emergency Tuesday — up four from Monday.

To make matters worse, the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority said Tuesday that it has to release more water from dams in the region because the reservoirs are filled to the brim.

""Essentially, the system is just absolutely saturated from starting with spring runoff and then just rain event after rain event,"" said authority spokesman Dale Hjertaas.

""Everything is full. The river channels are full, the sloughs are full and now the reservoir capacity is full as well. Each time it rains more of the water is moving on downstream and producing flows that none of us has seen before.""

The problem area starts about an hour and a half southeast of Regina. Estevan is of particular concern because it sits on the Souris close to two major dams — Boundary and Rafferty.

Increased outflows from Boundary Dam are expected to raise water levels downstream by about 20 centimetres. The outflow is also being increased at Alameda Dam near Oxbow, Sask.
St. Onge said he understands there were no other options.

""They have to release what they've got. You can't have the water going over the top of the dam. They don't really have any choice so we just have to try and live with what they're sending down.""
The mayor said so far, they've been able to protect the water treatment plant, although staff are getting to the site by boat.
Colin King, deputy commissioner of emergency management, said the increase outflow means there will be even more water in Roche Percee, near the U.S. border. Much of the village of about 160 people is already submerged.

In all, Emergency Social Services in Saskatchewan estimates that nearly 800 people have been forced from their homes across the region. Officials said the exact number is hard to pinpoint because many evacuees are staying with family or friends, not in shelters.

There were also problems east of Regina, where the Trans-Canada Highway remained closed for a second day Tuesday because it was submerged under several metres of water.
Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall is hoping Ottawa will help bail out communities affected by flooding.

Wall spoke Tuesday with Prime Minister Stephen Harper about disaster aid and flood protection. The premier said there's been concern that some flood damage won't be covered because it's man-made — such as when a rural municipality intentionally breaches a road to divert water away from property or people.
""I was able to raise that with the prime minister and say, well, clearly these RMs wouldn't be cutting the roads if there weren't a flood. The flood's the cause, the disaster's the cause,"" said Wall.
""And he said, well, you know we'll have a look at that. He's already committed to fund permanent works ... to mitigate against further damage.""

Saskatchewan announced a $22 million program in February to help communities, rural municipalities and individuals prepare for spring flooding. That was after the watershed authority warned there was a high likelihood of flooding from the spring runoff, especially in the southern part of the province.

The provincial government topped up the program with another $30 million. Wall said Tuesday that figure could near $100 million.

The premier also spoke with Harper about help for Saskatchewan farmers. Flooding is expected to leave about two million hectares unseeded this year in Saskatchewan. Last year, the federal government and the three Prairie provinces pumped an additional $450 million into a program to cover farmland that couldn't be seeded or was washed out after seeding due to near non-stop rain.

Wall said there will be a review on how the flood was handled, including reservoir management, but he hoped people wouldn't look to lay blame.

""It's a dangerous thing to hindsight this thing,"" said Wall.
""How do you deal with five, seven inches in a weekend? What release back in March can predict that future event? So I would be loathe to second-guess the hydrologists and the experts too much at this point. Hindsight's pretty easy and people understandably are very stressed.""

While the situation is bad in Saskatchewan, it is worse downstream in Minot, N.D.

The Souris River is set to overtop levees there, promising to swamp thousands of homes and businesses. Some 10,000 residents have been ordered to leave their homes — about a quarter of the city's population.

There are international agreements in place to make sure water released from the dams don't harm anyone downstream, including in Manitoba, where the Souris River eventually loops around and joins the Assiniboine River. Wall said the dams have prevented flooding over the decades and the release is important now to protect the integrity of the dams.

Hjertaas said there's nothing Saskatchewan can do to hold back the flow.

""The storage capacity in the dams has been used and so there is not capacity to reduce the impact on Minot. Obviously they would like us to reduce flows as quickly as we can ... but what we can do we are doing and or have done,"" said Hjertaas.

""They understand the situation that when a dam is full, it's full.""
Hjertaas said it's tough to know when water levels might go down.

""At least for a couple of days, the flows are going to stay high. If it would quit raining, then it could start going down,"" he said.",2014-05-04T04:52:08.063429,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Cambria No 6', 'postalCode': 'S0C', 'formattedAddress': 'Cambria No 6, SK, Canada'}, 'coords': [-103.3471, 49.244314]}",9bYS1eloTiuAGVW3QCHocA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-06-21T14:50:00.000Z,14521-281,ushahidi,"""Everything is full""; Water has nowhere to go in Saskatchewan; dams being opened","[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'High Water Levels', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:07:58.875396,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Cambria No 6,"Cambria No 6, SK, Canada",S0C,,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Cambria No 6', 'postalCode': 'S0C', 'formattedAddress': 'Cambria No 6, SK, Canada'}","[-103.3471, 49.244314]",49.244314,-103.3471,Flood Hazards,High Water Levels,,en

Heavy rain in recent days has added to flood managers' woes as the Souris River and reservoirs at two dams are spilling over their banks, The (Regina) Leader-Post reported.

In one mobile home park alone, at least 400 people were evacuated Sunday, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said.

Saskatchewan Watershed Authority spokesman Dale Hjertaas told reporters the Rafferty dam in particular was overwhelmed and a controlled release was inevitable.

""Rafferty was designed to provide flood protection at the one-in-100-year flood event and we're having much more than that,"" he said.

The deliberate release of floodwaters was flowing at a rate fast enough to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool every five seconds, the CBC said.

Jen Davidson says her home had seven feet of water in the basement by earlier Saturday. It was a place in the city’s northeast end that she rented for herself and her two young daughters. Her landlord helped the single mother with two nights in a hotel then told her she was on her own.

“So much of our things were destroyed,” Davidson said. “We’re now living out of a suitcase.”

Stanley Gorniak has been sleeping on a cot in the Crescent Point Place arena since Saturday. He was one of the many people evacuated from the Navo Trailer Park. The flooding hit in the middle of the night and it was a roommate that noticed water spilling into the bedrooms.

In the course of a couple of hours their trailer was surrounded by a few feet of rushing water and it wasn’t until rescue crew arrived with boats that they were saved.

“I packed some stuff into a bag but then I figured with all the people in the boat that it would be too much of a hindrance,” said Gorniak adding he’s hoping to get back home to see what can be saved.

Staying at the evacuation centre he's hoping to get back home to see what can be saved.

As of Monday there were more than 500 people registered with the Red Cross in Weyburn and Estevan. Of those nearly 60 were forced to seek refuge in the shelters.

2014-05-09 19:07:59.888962,"While he has tried to remain stoic, it is sometimes difficult for Roche Percee Mayor Reg Jahn to hide his emotions after watching water swallow much of his village.

""I want to cry,"" Jahn said Monday. ""A guy is sick, but you have to realize there is nothing you can do.""

As of midday Monday, all but about 20 of Roche Percee's 200 residents had evacuated as water levels on the Souris River continued to rise.

While it was expected that some homes in Roche Percee would flood as more water was released from the Rafferty and Boundary dams upstream, residents did not guess that so many would be affected.

Jahn thought his own home would be safe because it is situated six feet higher than what was considered the flood level.

Now his basement is full of water and he expects that there may also be water on the main floor. At least one home on the valley floor, he suggested, could be completely submerged.

The evacuations weren't limited to that town as 400 people were ordered from Willow Park Greens Trailer Park near Estevan late Sunday. Dozens more have left their homes in the surrounding rural municipality.

The water level on the Souris through Estevan and Roche Percee was rising again Monday after the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority was forced on Sunday to increase outflows from Rafferty and Boundary from 450 cubic metres per second (cms) to a combined 555 cms, which it was anticipated would increase the level on the river by a halfmetre.

On Monday, the combined outflow was increased to 638 cms and another 30 cms were expected to be released from Boundary either Monday night or today, bringing the total downstream to 668 cms.

""The bottom line is there is an awful lot of rainfall and an awful lot of water is coming,"" said Dale Hjertaas, executive director of policy and communications with the watershed authority. ""The capacity of the reservoir to hold it back is limited and therefore most of it needs to be passed on through at this point.

""Rafferty was designed to provide flood protection at the one-in-100-year flood event and we're having much more than that.""

It is expected that outflows will remain high for at least the rest of this week.

The rainwater was also forcing drivers to take detours around the province. The Trans-Canada Highway was closed Monday between Whitewood and Balgonie - a 150-kilometre stretch - which led drivers on a 275km detour to Yorkton.

Highway 39 north of Weyburn was closed to westbound traffic and Highway 35 south of the city was closed entirely.

Highway 18 west of Estevan was closed, as was Highway 47 between Estevan and the U.S. border. Dozens of rural roads in the area are topped with water.

The water has also restricted access into Sask-Power's Boundary Dam power station since the Crown corporation could not haul coal over the only road that is still accessible. There are 170,000 tonnes of coal stockpiled which should last several weeks.

Many displaced residents seem to be doing well despite their latest hardships - although the shock has been harder on some than others.

""One of the young ladies with a young family stopped to talk to me,"" Jahn recalled, ""And said, 'It could be worse. If we'd have had a tornado and our kids were gone, we wouldn't know where they were. That would be worse than this because at least we're safe. We may be out of our homes and we may lose everything, but we can always build.'

2014-05-09 19:08:00.090911,"In terms of flood misery per capita, it would be hard to beat the tiny town of Roche Percee in the southeast corner of Saskatchewan.

Following a weekend of heavy rains and a release of water from major dams in the area, much of the village of 147 people is under water.

The village, which is built in a valley, had survived several recent waves of water from the overflowing Souris River, but what happened Sunday proved too much.

Water started flowing over the dikes at around 7:30 a.m. CST Sunday. Much of the town was evacuated.

By Monday morning, the lowest areas were under as much as seven metres of water, according to Sharon Wells, the village's deputy mayor.

Looking around the village today, she said, she felt like crying.

""I can't begin to imagine how the people down on the bottom feel,"" she said. ""Some were new homes, some they've been there for 40 years and its just uncomprehensible. I don't know. No words to decribe it.""

The community about 25 kilometres east of Estevan is more than a century old. It's hard to imagine how it can recover from a disaster of this magnitude, Wells said.

Wells lives on higher ground and her home wasn't wrecked, but roughly 47 out of 63 homes were flooded, she said.

""I can't see a lot of them rebuilding,"" she said. ""Insurance really doesn't cover everything.""

Some people were trying to get to their homes by boat Monday to salvage things, but the current was just too strong, she said.

People in the community are angry, she said. Some are upset with the village, saying it didn't do enough to prepare people, while some blame the province for releasing water from dam reservoirs upstream.

Still others are upset that the news media hasn't reported more on what is happening, she said.

The Saskatchewan Watershed Authority has been releasing water from Estevan area dams in recent weeks because the dams are full.

The amount of water coming out of the Boundary and Rafferty dams is now about 630 cubic metres per second — enough to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool in about four seconds.

Because there was more than 100 millimetres of rain in some areas over the weekend, more releases may be needed in the days ahead, the watershed authority said.",2014-05-04T04:52:21.012623,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Roche Percee', 'streetAddress': 'Souris Ave & Division Ave', 'postalCode': 'S0C', 'formattedAddress': 'Souris Ave & Division Ave, Roche Percee, SK S0C, Canada'}, 'coords': [-102.801397, 49.068562]}",9bIjYI4uSGCJaAiYtokLpA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-06-20T18:15:00.000Z,14521-266,ushahidi,Roche Percee community deep under water,"[{'name': 'Damaged Property', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'High Water Levels', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:08:00.090911,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Roche Percee,"Souris Ave & Division Ave, Roche Percee, SK S0C, Canada",S0C,Souris Ave & Division Ave,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Roche Percee', 'streetAddress': 'Souris Ave & Division Ave', 'postalCode': 'S0C', 'formattedAddress': 'Souris Ave & Division Ave, Roche Percee, SK S0C, Canada'}","[-102.801397, 49.068562]",49.068562,-102.801397,Damaged Property,Flood Hazards,High Water Levels,en
2014-05-09 19:08:01.364407,"With more water flowing into the reservoirs at Boundary and Rafferty dams in southeast Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan Watershed Authority officials have been forced to let more water out, likely leading to another half metre of water downstream in Estevan and Roche Percee.

The outflows from the dams, which were increased Sunday afternoon from 450 cubic metres per second (cms) to 550 cms and again on Monday morning to 630 cms, forced the evacuation of Willow Park Greens Trailer Park near Estevan late Sunday and put more homes in Roche Percee at risk of flooding.

It is expected the high flows will remain for at least the rest of this week.

“The bottom line is there is an awful lot of rainfall and an awful lot of water is coming,” said Dale Hjertaas, executive director of policy and communications with the watershed authority. “The capacity of the reservoir to hold it back is limited and therefore most of it needs to be passed on through at this point.

“Rafferty was designed to provide flood protection at the one-in-100-year flood event and we’re having much more than that.”

With much of the ground around Weyburn and Estevan already saturated, some areas received more than 100 millimetres of rain over the past few days, much of which eventually runs into the Souris River through the dams.

Several homes in Weyburn were flooded with water and sewage backup — anywhere from a few inches to several feet — and 30 people had to be evacuated from a trailer park on Saturday.

All but 20 of Roche Percee’s 200 residents have left their homes in the village southeast of Estevan. Many of the homes on the valley floor in the town are believed to have several feet of water on their main floors and Mayor Reg Jahn expected at least one house was almost completely submerged.

The water has also led to several highway closures in Saskatchewan.

A stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway is underwater near Wolseley forcing traffic in both directions to be rerouted.

2014-05-09 19:08:00.540671,"Moose Jaw’s firefighters know what it is like to deal with flooding in 2011, and as another city seeks to handle high waters, they put their skills to use once again.

Six members of the Moose Jaw Fire Department travelled to Weyburn late Sunday night, taking on a shift in the city early Monday morning. Moose Jaw’s crew responded to one alarm while in Weyburn.

“We were pitching in for their crews who had been on flood duty since Friday and they have been a bit overwhelmed. They asked for some assistance just to get a bit of a break,” explained fire chief Garth Palmer. 

Palmer said the local crew took their own pumper truck and service half-ton for the duty. They did not participate in any flood prevention activities while there. 

Palmer said the chance Moose Jaw would help again is “remote.” He said the provincial government was enlisting some wildfire firefighters from the north to help today.

When flooding hit Moose Jaw in April, Palmer said it never got to the point where Moose Jaw requested outside help.

Rains over the weekend caused widespread flooding in Weyburn, Estevan, and a number of surrounding communities already dealing with high water levels. Since Friday, Weyburn has received approximately 112 millimetres of rain.

2014-05-09 19:08:00.955113,"Communities across soggy southeastern Saskatchewan are dealing with displaced residents, sewage-flooded basements and suspect drinking water — the unwanted byproducts of days of rain that has overwhelmed rivers and swollen reservoirs.

""It's pretty ugly,"" said Dustin Bell, who said there's so much water around his home a couple of kilometres northeast of Weyburn that he can't drive out to get to work.

""Unfortunately we can't stop because of this so we had to get a rope and a boat and pull ourselves in.""

The Saskatchewan Watershed Authority warned Monday that levels could rise another half metre in the partially flooded communities of Estevan and Roche Percee, downstream from Weyburn, after more water was released from dams on the Souris River.

Some residents say they don't understand why floodgates on the dams are being opened when communities downstream are already under water.

But authority spokesman Dale Hjertaas said the reservoirs simply can't hold back the huge amount of water.

""Everything is very saturated so all the water is running off now,"" Hjertaas said.

""The bottom line is ... an awful lot of rain fell and an awful lot of water is coming, and the capacity of the reservoir to hold it back is limited. Therefore, most of it needs to be passed on through at this point.""

The areas affected were along the Souris, about an hour and a half southeast of Regina. There were also problems just east of Regina, where the Trans-Canada Highway was closed Monday because it was submerged under several metres of water.

Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall toured the southern areas Monday and said it's not clear yet how much it will cost the government to help the communities.

""It's in the millions of dollars certainly and there's two levels of costs. There would be one to the municipalities that already had a lot of stressed infrastructure because of so much rain,"" said Wall.

""We've just told them, do what you need to do and we'll be there for you.""

Wall, who delayed his trip to the western premiers conference in Yellowknife, called the torrents of water that have washed through the area unprecedented.

""We went over to Rafferty (Dam) and I can't give you a description,"" said Wall.

""I have no more adjectives, I have no more superlatives and I'm a politician so I shouldn't be lost for words maybe, but I am. It's hard to describe what you see driving around Weyburn, what these folks have been dealing with.""

The premier said the provincial disaster assistance program gets help from the federal government. But he added they need to work together to prevent future flooding of such magnitude.

""There are some things we need to do soon in this region for responsible relief of the water pressures.""

Environment Canada said that as of Monday morning, Estevan has had 287 millimetres of rain since May 1, making this the wettest May-June period since records began in 1945. The agency said 112 millimetres of rain had fallen in Weyburn since Friday and more rain was expected Monday.

People were out of their homes in Roche Percee, a tiny community near Estevan with a population of 160. Residents reported seeing a dike breach on the weekend that put much of the community under water.

The Willow Park Greens Trailer Park on the outskirts of Estevan was also under an evacuation order affecting about 400 people.

There was a precautionary boil water advisory in the City of Weyburn because of problems at the sewage plant. A trailer park outside the city was also evacuated. Some homes and businesses had water or sewage in their basements, including The Family Place, a community resource centre.

""We had upwards of two feet of sewage in our basement and we've basically been evicted from our building,"" said Clark Gordon, chairman of the board at The Family Place.

""You can't spend more than two or three minutes in there without feeling sick just because of the smell.""

Gordon said everything in the basement, including toys and a play room, are now useless. The basement will have to be gutted and the building cleaned before the centre can open again. He hopes to get some of the program running at another location, but it will take time for the centre to get back on its feet.

""I mean we've got a mess on our hands. That mess has to be cleaned up.""

Highway 39 that runs through Weyburn looked more like a tributary of the Souris River than a roadway, as water submerged the city's main bridge Monday.

Farmer Al Watson, 75, of Yellow Grass, said he's lived in the area his whole life and has never seen so much water.

""I do remember one time we had more rain, but it was drier when it started,"" said Watson.

""A lot of the problem this year has been that the ground was so saturated (from the snowpack) and really there was no place for the water to soak in.""

In all, 20 communities were under a state of emergency Monday because of flooding.

Weyburn Mayor Debra Button said the city is experiencing difficulties with the electrical system at its main sewage lift station. Button said the community is pulling together but it has been stressful.

""I think initially everyone has shock. Then you go from shock to anger to can't believe it to 'what am I going to do' and there's despair in there as well. You know, we're watching for signs of that within the community,"" said Button.

""And we're reminding people, it's not worth staying in your house if you've got water or effluent ... Get out.""

Colin King, the province's deputy fire commissioner, said many homeowners were feeling the pain.

""The amount of flow they are getting now is higher now than it has been previously this spring and it is affecting them quite dramatically ... (there are) a significant amount of homes with water in their basement,whether it be from seepage or overland flooding through the windows or from sewer backup — that sort of thing.""

King said it's tough to estimate how many have been forced to leave their homes, noting some people went to stay with family or friends and may not have registered with shelters.

There could be more evacuations over the next few days, he added.

The watershed authority also warned Monday that flows on the North Saskatchewan River in Edmonton are high and that will cause the river to rise as much as two metres when it reaches the Battlefords by mid-week and Prince Albert on Friday or Saturday.

Those increased flows on the North Saskatchewan River from rain in Alberta will combine with the already swollen South Saskatchewan River.

2014-05-09 19:07:59.991170,"Communities across soggy southeastern Saskatchewan are dealing with displaced residents, sewage-flooded basements and suspect drinking water - the unwanted byproducts of days of rain that has overwhelmed rivers and swollen reservoirs.

The Saskatchewan Watershed Authority on Monday was predicting that levels would rise another half metre in the partially flooded communities of Estevan and Roche Percee after more water was released from dams on the Souris River.

Some residents have said they don't understand why floodgates on the dams are being opened when communities downstream are already under water. But authority spokesman Dale Hjertaas said the reservoirs simply can't hold back the huge amount of water.

""Everything is very saturated so all the water is running off now,"" Hjertaas said. ""The bottom line is ... an awful lot of rain fell and an awful lot of water is coming, and the capacity of the reservoir to hold it back is limited. Therefore, most of it needs to be passed on through at this point.""

The areas affected were along the Souris, about an hour and a half southeast of Regina.

Environment Canada said that as of Monday morning Estevan had had 287 millimetres of rain since May 1, making this the wettest May-June period since records began in 1945. The agency said 112 millimetres of rain had fallen in Weyburn since Friday and more rain was expected Monday.

People were out of their homes in Roche Percee, a tiny community near Estevan with a population 160. Residents reported seeing a dike breach on the weekend that put much of the community under water.

The Willow Park Greens Trailer Park on the outskirts of Estevan was also under an evacuation order affecting about 400 people.

There was a precautionary boil water advisory in the City of Weyburn because of problems at the city's sewage plant. A trailer park outside the city was evacuated. Some homes had water or sewage in their basements.

Weyburn Mayor Debra Button said water was flowing over the main bridge at points.

""Our water levels are coming up and we are still experiencing difficulties with the electrical system at our main sewage lift station,"" Button said.

Colin King, the province's deputy fire commissioner, said many homeowners were feeling the pain.

""The amount of flow they are getting now is higher now than it has been previously this spring and it is affecting them quite dramatically ... (there are) a significant amount of homes with water in their basement whether it be from seepage or overland flooding through the windows or from sewer backup - that sort of thing.""

Dustin Bell lives just a couple of kilometres northwest Weyburn and said there was so much water he couldn't use his vehicle to go to work.

""It's pretty ugly,"" Bell said. ""Unfortunately we can't stop because of this so we had to get a rope and a boat and pull ourselves in.""

Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall delayed his trip to a western premiers conference so he could tour the affected area Monday.

2014-05-09 19:08:00.454443,"The whole Souris Watershed is in a major flood situation with over one hundred millimeters of rain this weekend and there's more rain in the forecast.

The Saskatchewan Watershed Authority has had to increase the outflows from both the Rafferty and Alameda Dams because there's just no capacity in them anymore and Boundary Dam may be next.

The Authority's Dale Hjertaas (jertas) says the water level downstream is expected to rise yet another half a metre through Estevan.

On the South Saskatchewan River, at Lake Diefenbaker, the outflows will remain the same at Gardiner Dam to create some capacity, but the inflows are expected to ease up because there's been no more rain in Alberta.

On the North Saskatchewan River, through Prince Albert, the water level is expected to rise 2 and a half metres and where the two rivers meet they'll head through Tobin Lake and over to Cumberland House where preparations for a major flooding event are underway.

SaskPower's James Parker says they had to disconnect people in Weyburn, Estevan and Roche Percee due to the flooding.

The RCMP have closed Highway One in both directions as a result of flood water.

Eastbound traffic is being re-routed onto Highway 10 at Balgonie. 

Westbound traffic on the TransCanada is being stopped at Whitewood and sent North on Highway 9.

2014-05-09 19:08:01.271410,"Flood-battered residents of southeast Saskatchewan fled their homes Sunday after another night of heavy rain.

About 400 people were ordered to leave the Willow Park Greens trailer park at Estevan, about 200 kilometres southeast of Regina, amid new flood threats after water was released from dams and 27 millimetres of rain fell overnight.

Holly Boreski said she received a knock on the door at around 11 p.m. CST and was told she had to leave immediately.

""You know, grab a duffle bag of clothes and go. I have four children so it's most important just to get out,"" she said.

Some evacuees ended up staying at an emergency shelter in the city while others were staying with family.

On Monday, when she returned to salvage some frozen food, there was about 60 centimetres of water on the roads around homes in the park, Boreski said.

Estevan situation worsens
Meanwhile, the flooding situation was much worse for some farmers downstream of the Rafferty and Boundary dams.

The Saskatchewan Watershed Authority said late Sunday it would increase combined floods from the dam reservoirs to 550 cubic metres per second — enough to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool every five seconds.

That's bad news for Guy Mehler who, with the help of family and friends, had to build a two-metre high earthen dike around his home on the weekend.

Monday morning the water was just about 30 centimetres from flowing over the top, he said.

""It's a terrible feeling,"" he said, adding that if the water-flow out of the reservoirs is increased again, he expects he'll be flooded.

He has a boat gassed up and ready to go, he said.

""I've lived here for 30 years and I've never, ever, ever, seen anything like this before,"" Mehler said. ""It's just water from one side of the valley to another.""

Weyburn gets another 40 mm of rain
There have also been people forced out of their homes in Weyburn, northwest of Estevan.

The town declared a state of emergency last week after torrential rains overwhelmed the sewer system.

Since Friday, Weyburn has received 112 millimetres of rain, with 40 mm falling Sunday night.

In the surrounding area, fields are filled with water and many farmers have given up on planting a crop this year. Monday morning, a CBC reporter saw a number of two-metre tall hay bales almost completely under water.

About a dozen evacuees stayed overnight at the emergency shelter at a local rink, but 160 people have registered with the emergency centre, said George Barker, a Red Cross regional co-ordinator.

Some people had sewage backing up into their homes and had to leave for health and safety reasons, he said.

According to Environment Canada, more showers and thunderstorms are expected again Monday over southeast Saskatchewan.

Another 15 to 30 millimetres is possible by evening, the weather agency said. Estevan has received 287 millimetres of rain since May 1, making it the wettest May-June period since record-keeping began in 1945.",2014-05-04T04:52:30.443872,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Estevan', 'streetAddress': '802 6th St', 'postalCode': 'S4A', 'formattedAddress': '802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada'}, 'coords': [-102.986111, 49.139167]}",EYMQIpsIS-yYAQknhyAs8A,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-06-20T10:28:00.000Z,14521-269,ushahidi,Floods displace hundreds in Estevan and Weyburn,"[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'High Water Levels', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:08:01.271410,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Estevan,"802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada",S4A,802 6th St,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Estevan', 'streetAddress': '802 6th St', 'postalCode': 'S4A', 'formattedAddress': '802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada'}","[-102.986111, 49.139167]",49.139167,-102.986111,Flood Hazards,High Water Levels,,en

2014-05-09 19:08:02.275244,"The Saskatchewan Premier wanted disaster response at the top of the agenda for this week’s Western Premiers’ Conference, but Brad Wall will be a little late for the meeting. He has to attend to yet another flood.

Up to six inches of rain has fallen since Thursday in parts of southeastern Saskatchewan, forcing hundreds of people to leave their homes in a half dozen communities.

In flat Saskatchewan, where floods are usually slow-rising, broad and shallow, one official said this was the closest thing to a flash flood he’s seen in the province.

Flood gates were opened at two dams along the Souris River, which snakes through Estevan, Weyburn and a series of small towns before running through North Dakota and back into Manitoba. Roads were washed away, hundreds of basements were flooded, and water and sewer services were knocked out of commission.

“The ground is just saturated. The river is still rising, but more slowly. So now we’re just watching the sky,” said Weyburn Mayor Deb Button, who had scores of volunteers filling sandbags and dozens of evacuees staying in a hockey arena on Sunday.

Even in the wettest springs, Prairie waters usually recede well before summer. Not this year, which has been described as one in 150.

“We just had another downpour. It just doesn’t want to quit,” Shirley Cancade, the mayor of Radville, Sask., said early Sunday evening after the town of 1,000 declared a state of emergency and shut down its water pumping station.

Ms. Button and Ms. Cancade will greet Mr. Wall Monday morning. The Premier will tour flood stricken areas as he skips the first day of the premiers’ meeting in Yellowknife.

Like dozens of municipal officials in Saskatchewan, Ms. Cancade hopes Mr. Wall will come with money to fix roads and broken sewer and water plants.

“Our infrastructure is in so much trouble right now. We don’t even have the full picture right now. If it ever dries up, maybe we’ll get it,” Ms. Cancade said. “You just get numb after a while but you try to deal with the situation at hand.”

Mr. Wall and the other Western premiers are calling on Ottawa to contribute more to disaster response and to come up with a formal national strategy.

It’s been a wet spring across much of Canada. Flooding has been most obvious in southern Quebec and Manitoba, where rivers spilled over their banks in spectacular fashion, causing millions in damage.

In southeastern Saskatchewan, most grain farmers have given up on the year. Those who managed to do some seeding say the latest downpours will rot anything in the ground. It’s now too late to beat autumn frost for most crops.

Ken and Jan Gran, who farm near Radville, say parts of their land dried up just enough to seed some hay a few weeks ago. Hay is a crop of last resort when time has run out to sow wheat, barley, canola and other higher-value crops.

“Our hay was coming up okay, but now it’s going to be too wet to get in there and cut. It’s going to rot,” Ms. Gran said as she watched threatening clouds build for yet another storm.

Saskatchewan Agriculture says only 44 per cent of crops are sown in the southeast. As happened to the Grans, much of it will be lost after the weekend storm.",2014-05-04T04:52:37.380077,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Radville', 'streetAddress': 'Floren St & Anderson Ave / Railway Ave', 'postalCode': 'S0C', 'formattedAddress': 'Floren St & Anderson Ave / Railway Ave, Radville, SK S0C, Canada'}, 'coords': [-104.294109, 49.460282]}",Bhd4tyS-SpKrp-dBVu9z_Q,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-06-20T05:37:00.000Z,14521-271,ushahidi,Heavy rains flood southeastern Saskatchewan,"[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:08:02.275244,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Radville,"Floren St & Anderson Ave / Railway Ave, Radville, SK S0C, Canada",S0C,Floren St & Anderson Ave / Railway Ave,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Radville', 'streetAddress': 'Floren St & Anderson Ave / Railway Ave', 'postalCode': 'S0C', 'formattedAddress': 'Floren St & Anderson Ave / Railway Ave, Radville, SK S0C, Canada'}","[-104.294109, 49.460282]",49.460282,-104.294109,Flood Hazards,,,en
2014-05-09 19:08:01.063681,"Even after watching sewage gurgle out of the toilet and shower in the basement of his Weyburn home, Verne Cooke was still calling himself lucky.

""There's people in other places a lot worse off,"" Cooke said Sunday as he, his son and grandson pushed the last of the 46 centimetres of water and sewage that crept into his home toward a sump pit. The sewage started to back up in his home of 54 years on Friday morning and didn't stop until Sunday morning. ""The only other time we got it was '79 and it only got up about two inches.""

Cooke didn't have to look far to see how much worse off others in southeastern Saskatchewan were after torrential rain fell on the area on Friday. Some areas saw as much as 80 millimetres.

Cooke's son Kevin, a volunteer firefighter, helped evacuate residents - some by boat - out of the Navou trailer court on the northwestern edge of town Saturday. Others in Weyburn had anywhere from a few cm to almost two metres of water in their basements.

And further south sat the village of Roche Percee, a town Cooke frequented, almost fully swallowed by the overflowing Souris River.

Most of the 200 residents of Roche Percee evacuated their homes on Saturday or Sunday. Water being released from the Boundary and Rafferty dams upstream sent a combined total of 450 cubic metres of water per second into the area. During the flooding that occurred earlier in the spring, only 211 cubic metres passed through.

The increased flows pushed water over the berms around Roche Percee and through sandbags. Dozens of homes in the lower part of the valley at the town site were flooded, although it was difficult to tell just how badly they were affected because the high water kept anyone from getting close.

Sharon Wells, the village's deputy mayor, said only the top of the roof of a small shack in a riverside park could be seen by Sunday evening. Wells said the houses were all on ground at least a few feet higher than the shack, but guessed many would have water on their main floors.

Even homes up the valley wall were being threatened, she noted, and an outdoor hockey rink halfway up the hill was full of water.

With the two main roads into the village covered by several inches of water, the only access into Roche Percee was through the yards of two area farmers.

Along one of the roads into town, a large blue Quonset was half underwater, and a wall of sandbags around a home just off Highway 39 near the village was broken, making the house look like an island in the middle of a prairie lake.

Wells was told that the release from the dams would stay steady at 450 cm for three days.

Around the Rural Municipality of Estevan it was much the same story. Following the increased flows from the dams after Friday's downpour, several more homes that hadn't seen any water this spring were flooded - some just in the basement and others on main floors. At least 40 families had evacuated their homes in the RM as of Sunday. Highway 18 between Estevan and Torquay was closed as it was underwater. Some stretches of Highway 39 in the area looked more like long bridges over even bigger lakes.

""It's hard to believe that three hours away their crops aren't germinating because they have no rain,"" said Wells. ""And we're getting a four-inch dump every time a cloud goes by.""

That much was true on Sunday night as heavy rains once again pounded the Weyburn area with the potential for 30 mm, which could compound the already severe problems. More showers are in the forecast for today.

On Sunday, parts of the Navou trailer court in Weyburn were still underwater as resident Dorothy Fredrick wondered what was becoming of her home. She went to bed Friday night and there wasn't even rain falling. By the time emergency workers woke her, her trailer was surrounded by water and she had to be evacuated by boat.

""We'll see what the heck is there, but there's going to be a lot of cleaning to do . . . and I've got a car that's probably full of water,"" she said.

For Weyburn Mayor Deb Button, the residents of the city banded together to get everyone else through the first phase.

""We're managing OK but I'm so proud of how this community has come together,"" she said Sunday. ""In the last couple of days, I've seen things that have just made my heart sing. How people have pulled together and helped their neighbours and seen us through as a city. I've always been proud of this community, but I'm very, very proud today.""",2014-05-04T04:52:36.221416,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Weyburn', 'streetAddress': '192 3rd St', 'postalCode': 'S4H', 'formattedAddress': '192 3rd St, Weyburn, SK S4H, Canada'}, 'coords': [-103.853103, 49.662969]}",u2WpkuVMR_OWByBrIMJ4IA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-06-20T03:27:00.000Z,14521-272,ushahidi,Torrential rains flood Weyburn,"[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'High Water Levels', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:08:01.063681,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Weyburn,"192 3rd St, Weyburn, SK S4H, Canada",S4H,192 3rd St,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Weyburn', 'streetAddress': '192 3rd St', 'postalCode': 'S4H', 'formattedAddress': '192 3rd St, Weyburn, SK S4H, Canada'}","[-103.853103, 49.662969]",49.662969,-103.853103,Flood Hazards,High Water Levels,,en

On Friday night, the City of Weyburn declared a state of emergency after 24 hours of heavy rain caused an electrical failure at the city's waste water treatment plant.

“The city's infrastructure is taxed to the limit,” Weyburn mayor Debra Button said in a press release. “City crews are working to keep the system functioning but we are asking all city residents to help us deal with this emergency situation.”

A boil water order has been put in place as a precaution, and residents are being asked not to use sump pumps, as the city cannot cope with additional waste water at this time.

“All residents of southeast Saskatchewan are doing their best in the face of extreme flooding. We know we are not alone in dealing with this challenge but I want all Weyburn residents to know that we did everything possible to prepare for this emergency and are doing all we can to minimize the impact on our residents,” Button said.

Nineteen communities had declared states of emergency due to the extreme rainfall, including Yellow Grass, which according to Environment Canada had seen 78.2 mm by Friday afternoon.

Meanwhile, the town of Radville, 135 km south of Regina, has seen all its surrounding highways and some internal roads submerged.

“We have water absolutely everywhere,” said Radville Mayor Shirley Cancade told a local media outlet. “People are getting water in their basements and sewers backing up.”

The water in the town has been shut off and RCMP are recommending that people limit travel.

Regina is also dealing with localized flooding. Several underpasses were roped off Friday and classes at the University of Regina were closed because of the high water.

All of the wet weather has come from one system that's been slowly cycling over the Prairies.

“The jet stream's been stuck in a position across the Prairies that has given us a lot of days of active weather and systems that have been moving very slowly,” explains Weather Network meteorologist Chris Scott.

The good news is this latest low is starting to weaken as it rotates back towards central Alberta. Most of central and western Saskatchewan will continue to see showers through Sunday, but overall substantially less rain than Friday.",2014-05-04T04:52:40.918426,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Weyburn', 'streetAddress': '192 3rd St', 'postalCode': 'S4H', 'formattedAddress': '192 3rd St, Weyburn, SK S4H, Canada'}, 'coords': [-103.853103, 49.662969]}",sBCX3mnMRy-TYQw4MTW3Ew,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-06-19T01:09:00.000Z,14521-254,ushahidi,Weyburn struggles with flooding,"[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'High Water Levels', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:08:02.655402,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Weyburn,"192 3rd St, Weyburn, SK S4H, Canada",S4H,192 3rd St,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Weyburn', 'streetAddress': '192 3rd St', 'postalCode': 'S4H', 'formattedAddress': '192 3rd St, Weyburn, SK S4H, Canada'}","[-103.853103, 49.662969]",49.662969,-103.853103,Flood Hazards,High Water Levels,,en

2014-05-09 19:08:01.171475,"The release of rising waters from reservoirs along the Souris River is threatening to flood homes near Estevan, Sask., residents say.

The danger comes on the heels of a torrential downpour in southern Saskatchewan on Friday that led to a state of emergency in Weyburn and flooded streets in Regina and Saskatoon.

The storm raised levels on reservoirs along the Souris, forcing provincial officials to release water from the Rafferty dam to ease the pressure, and that could mean trouble for people living downstream.

Guy Mehler, who feared the outflow would consume his house near the Souris River not far from Estevan, made one desperate telephone call for help and was grateful when more than a dozen neighbours and friends showed up with enough equipment to build an earthen wall nearly two metres tall around his home.

""I was feeling real low, but when these guys show up, your attitude and feeling changes real quick,"" he told CBC News. ""We've got the men and the equipment and we're not going to stop until we feel we're safe.""

Mehler said he and his son can only wait and hope for the best.

""My son and I are going to hang around and keep watch on it,"" he said. ""If there are any weak spots when the water does come up, we have the equipment to patch it up. If it gets too high, we'll just evacuate.""

The village of Roche Percee, southeast of Estevan, could be flooded within two days, Mayor Reg Jahn said, affecting up to 30 homes.

""There's gonna be one house that's totally destroyed,"" he told CBC News. ""I don't know what that lady's gonna do. She lives off two minimum-wage jobs and, you know, she'll lose everything. But she's still got her life. You know, it's hard.""

The river can't be diked to save those homes because it will destroy a bridge and flood the entire town of about 160 people, the mayor said.

State of emergency
Earlier in the day, Weyburn declared a state of emergency after receiving more than 60 millimetres of rain, leading to an electrical failure and effluent overflow at the city's sewage lift station. Municipal officials are advising residents to boil their water just to be safe.

""We haven't seen an emergency like this in our community for many years, and this is a strain on our systems, obviously, it's a strain on the people,"" Weyburn Mayor Deb Button said.

Engineers have been called in to assess the sewer station.

'I was feeling real low, but when these guys show up, your attitude and feeling changes real quick.'
— Guy Mehler, a homeowner grateful for good friends
Elsewhere in the city, firefighters needed a boat to rescue dozens of people from a mobile home park on the outskirts early Saturday.

The Souris River has reached the highest level he has ever seen, city manager Bob Smith said Saturday. The city is beginning to return to normal, Smith said, though the town's infrastructure has reached its saturation point. Water in flooded basements is beginning to recede. Homeowners also got a bit of help from the City of Regina, which sent 35 pumps to help drain flooded basements.

The flash flooding caused when nearly 80 millimetres of rain fell in Yellow Grass and Radville added to Weyburn's woes, which is downriver from the two communities. Highway 39, which runs through Weyburn, has been shut down.

Those displaced by flooding are staying at the local hockey rink until they can get back in their homes.

Streets in both Saskatoon, which saw a power failure in the downtown core, and Regina had to be closed overnight due to flooding.

In Regina, wind gusts hit 70 km/h overnight, ripping branches from trees and downing others. ""We heard a big crash and looked out and there was one of the city trees had fallen over and all across Victoria Avenue,"" Regina resident Murray Loose said.

Several other trees around the city were torn from the roots because of the strong wind. City workers have already cleaned up most of the debris.

The towns of Assiniboia and Mortlach also saw major downpour, each receiving about 65 mm overnight.",2014-05-04T04:52:33.892040,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Estevan', 'streetAddress': '802 6th St', 'postalCode': 'S4A', 'formattedAddress': '802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada'}, 'coords': [-102.986111, 49.139167]}",o4i1YvISTxCx4Je8fB2ABg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-06-18T20:53:00.000Z,14521-256,ushahidi,New flood threat in southern Saskatchewan,"[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'High Water Levels', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:08:01.171475,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Estevan,"802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada",S4A,802 6th St,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Estevan', 'streetAddress': '802 6th St', 'postalCode': 'S4A', 'formattedAddress': '802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada'}","[-102.986111, 49.139167]",49.139167,-102.986111,Flood Hazards,High Water Levels,,en
2014-05-09 19:08:02.171685,"There are rising flooding concerns in a number of communities in southern Saskatchewan.

Estevan and Weyburn are the latest communities to declare states of emergency as a result of Friday’s torrential downpour

Firefighters resorted to using a boat to move 30 people out of a trailer park on the outskirts of Weyburn early Saturday.

“In some cases, there was up to a foot of water in the trailers,” said Duane McKay, director of emergency response with Corrections, Public Safety and Policing during Saturday’s provincial flood update.

Numerous homeowners in Weyburn and surrounding areas are pumping out flooded basements.

“Some were reporting that their basement has two or three feet of water in it,” McKay said. “Some have seepage and some of it is sewer backup coming into the homes as well. It is pretty much what we would have seen in and around Yorkton about a year ago where large numbers of homes were impacted.”

He didn’t know how many southern Saskatchewan homes were affected by water damage.

Radville and Yellow Grass declared states of emergency on Friday as several homes in each community were flooding.

“Most of the areas are seeing water conditions similar to what we saw in the spring flooding,” McKay said. “There are lots of fields covered with water. Highways have been topped over and of course grid roads have been at risk as well.”

Weyburn’s sewage lift station hit capacity as a result of the rainfall.

“The pumps can’t keep up,” McKay said. “As a result of that, they have had some difficulties with the water system. They have a boil water advisory on now.”

Pumps are available at Weyburn’s fire station for residents to use.

“They’re using every pump that they have available including irrigation pumps, even fire trucks to pump water back into the river,” McKay said.

Between 50 and 75 millimetres of intense rain on Friday resulted in a quick run-off, said John Fahlman, the director of hydrology and groundwater services for the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority (SWA).

“What we have in this case is a landscape that is completely soggy and saturated with all of the depressions full so when you get a very intense rain like this, the only thing that’s stopping it from coming any faster is that our land is flat, so it’s as close to a flash flood as you ever get on the Prairies,” Fahlman said.

In response to the heavy rainfall, the SWA increased outflows from Rafferty and Boundary reservoirs to a minimum combined outflow of 300 cubic metres per second at noon on Saturday.

During the past 24 hours, combined inflows to the Rafferty and Boundary dams peaked at approximately 500 cubic metres per second.

The dams were used to significantly reduce flooding downstream, but the Rafferty reservoir is rapidly nearing its maximum level requiring that outflows be increased.

The SWA notified the City of Estevan, the village of Roche Percee, the RM of Estevan and the Ministry of Corrections, Public Safety and Policing of increased outflows and expected increases.

Water levels are expected to be higher than they were in the spring — by 75 centimetres to one metre, Fahlman said Saturday.

The Estevan Emergency Measures Committee issued an evacuation alert for Willow Park Greens trailer park on Saturday.

The Estevan Police Service and the Estevan Fire and Rescue Service are advising residents of the alert and providing instructions to follow in the event of an evacuation order.

If evacuation is necessary, police and fire vehicles will go to the trailer park and sound sirens to alert residents who will be asked to report to the multi-purpose room at the Souris Valley Leisure and Aquatic Centre.

Residents can call the Estevan EMO emergency line at 306-634-1855, but should refrain from calling the Estevan police for information to prevent tying up the emergency lines.

Updates will be posted to the City of Estevan’s website (www.estevan.ca).

“Earlier in the spring, some of these areas that are currently at risk were at risk then, so we’re sending down equipment that might be able to mitigate the damage or cordon off an area so it doesn’t get flooded,” McKay said.

Residents are advised to take precautions, such as moving items out of basements and storing them in rubber totes.

“It’s prudent for people to plan for worse-case scenarios and then if it’s not that bad, then certainly your planning helped to mitigate the impact,” McKay said.

Five sections of highway are closed in southern Saskatchewan because of the high water level.

The closures are:

Highway 39, from the Junction of Highway 6 to Weyburn;

Highway 350 from the Junction of Highway 18 to the U.S. border;

Highway 18, west of Oungre;

Highway 58 between Gravelbourg and Shamrock; and

Highway 36, north of Willowbunch.

The heavy rainfall spelled trouble for the University of Regina on Friday. Sewers backed up at the U of R’s main and College Avenue campuses. The main campus re-opened at 7 a.m. on Saturday and the College Avenue is expected to re-open on Monday morning.",2014-05-04T04:52:38.577832,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Weyburn', 'streetAddress': '192 3rd St', 'postalCode': 'S4H', 'formattedAddress': '192 3rd St, Weyburn, SK S4H, Canada'}, 'coords': [-103.853103, 49.662969]}",LMlXoOlwS22HXWf1ZDxUyA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-06-18T19:01:00.000Z,14521-257,ushahidi,Weyburn and Estevan declare states of emergency,"[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'High Water Levels', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'Road Blockage', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:08:02.171685,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Weyburn,"192 3rd St, Weyburn, SK S4H, Canada",S4H,192 3rd St,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Weyburn', 'streetAddress': '192 3rd St', 'postalCode': 'S4H', 'formattedAddress': '192 3rd St, Weyburn, SK S4H, Canada'}","[-103.853103, 49.662969]",49.662969,-103.853103,Flood Hazards,High Water Levels,Road Blockage,en

“As Prairie hydrology goes, it’s as flashy as it ever gets,” John Fahlman told reporters during a news conference Saturday morning.

Fahlman says the only thing that stopped the water from moving any faster is that the land is flat.

Up to 75 millimetres of rain that fell on the province’s southeast over the past day has caused significant swelling of the Souris River.

Firefighters needed a boat to rescue about 30 people from a mobile home park on the outskirts of Weyburn early Saturday morning, where the water was over a metre deep and was up to the floors of many of the trailers.

“Some of the folks were definitely getting nervous. We’ve had water problems basically throughout the spring but not this severe,” says fire chief Steve Debienne.

“Due to the running water, there was a slight current in the area. It took crews about an hour to get people out of the area and into the shelter.”

The city’s sewage lift station has also overflowed and municipal officials are advising residents to boil their water, just to be on the safe side. A power outage in the area overnight due to high winds made dealing with the situation even tougher, the province says.

Homes have also flooded in the communities of Radville and Yellow Grass.

The province says it has to release water from several dams because the levels in their reservoirs at near maximum allowable levels, and the extra flow downstream is expected to cause flooding.

In Estevan, which bills itself as “The Sunshine Capital of Saskatchewan,” an evacuation alert has been issued for a trailer park. The municipality says it will alert residents of the park if the evacuation becomes mandatory by sounding the sirens from fire and police vehicles.

Duanee McKay with Saskatchewan’s emergency response department says warnings have been sent out to all the communities that might be affected, and that emergency dikes could be set up where necessary.

“Works that were either in place will be shored up, or additional works will be put in place —sandbagging, water tubes, whatever is required to see if we can mitigate the high flow that’s coming out of the reservoirs,” he said.

More rain is in the forecast, and flood officials in Saskatchewan say they are also waiting to see how much extra water will flow into the province from Alberta, particularly from the North Saskatchewan River around Edmonton where it has been raining heavily for several days.

2014-05-09 19:08:02.743985,"Heavy rainfall across Saskatchewan has made for a messy start to the weekend. Several communities have declared states of emergency including Weyburn, Estevan, Yellowgrass and Radville.

In Weyburn, a precautionary boil water advisory is in effect after flash flooding and a lift issue at the waste water treatment plant caused sewage backup in the city.

More than four inches feel in a very short period of time last night causing the Souris River to spill over the highway into the city. Residents of the trailer park were evacuated this morning, some by boat. The Red Cross is assisting at a shelter opened for residents who had sewage backup into their homes. Mayor Debbie Button says they don't believe the river has peaked, and are asking for ‘all hands on deck’ to help sandbag.

Meanwhile, Estevan is bracing for more flooding after word the watershed authority will be releasing more water from the Rafferty and Boundary dams thanks to yesterday’s rainfall.

In the small Village of Roche Percee, an evacuation order was issued on Saturday afternoon. The mayor, Reg Jahn, said he didn't believe the village's existing dikes would hold back the deluge and that even extra sandbags wouldn't help.

Jahn said that's because if the water got so high that sandbags were necessary, the village of about 150 has been told the railway bridge on the north side of town could wash out.

""If the bridge collapsed it would plug the river and we would lose the whole town,"" Jahn said. ""We lose either way.""

Heavier-than-normal flows on the North Saskatchewan kept a number of firefighters busy in Edmonton on Saturday morning when the strong current is reported to have caused several dragon boats, which are used for racing in the summer, to break away and drift downstream.",2014-05-04T04:52:39.751070,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Weyburn', 'streetAddress': '192 3rd St', 'postalCode': 'S4H', 'formattedAddress': '192 3rd St, Weyburn, SK S4H, Canada'}, 'coords': [-103.853103, 49.662969]}",Z08Ij37TRC-PhWHsOUZQ4g,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-06-18T13:09:00.000Z,14521-259,ushahidi,Closest thing to flash flood hits Saskatchewan,"[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'High Water Levels', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:08:02.371912,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Weyburn,"192 3rd St, Weyburn, SK S4H, Canada",S4H,192 3rd St,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Weyburn', 'streetAddress': '192 3rd St', 'postalCode': 'S4H', 'formattedAddress': '192 3rd St, Weyburn, SK S4H, Canada'}","[-103.853103, 49.662969]",49.662969,-103.853103,Flood Hazards,High Water Levels,,en

2014-05-09 19:08:02.059558,"The community of Cumberland House is preparing for flooding as a deluge of rainwater flows into he North and South Saskatchewan rivers his weekend.

Water is already encroaching on Highway 123, the road leading to the isolated community 440 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon.

Colin King, the province's deputy fire commissioner, says the government has rounded up helicopters prepared to evacuate people who have medical emergencies. No one had been evacuated as of Friday afternoon, he said.

""A full-scale evacuation is not being considered at this time,"" King says. Unlike during a 2005 flood threat, the community of about 2,000 people plans to stay put as workers today begin constructing three berms around the Cumberland House Cree Nation and the village of Cumberland House.

In addition to more water barrelling down the South Saskatchewan River through Saskatoon and toward Tobin Lake, John Fahlman, acting director of basin operations for the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority, says a rainstorm is hitting central Alberta that's expected to speed up the North Saskatchewan River.

A peak is supposed to hit Edmonton today, which will move downstream through Saskatchewan.

Environment Canada says much of Saskatchewan can expect showers to continue for much of today with lesser chances of precipitation on Sunday.

Fahlman says preliminary SWA estimates show the river will rise about two metres in the North Battleford area and about 2.5 metres in the Prince Albert area, peaking about five days from now.

Cumberland MLA Doyle Vermette raised an alarm Friday that Highway 123 has become ""virtually impassible,"" placing residents in ""an unsafe situation with food and supplies unable to reach the town and air ambulance service inaccessible due to the crumbling state of the community's airstrip.""

Saskatchewan Highways and Infrastructure spokesperson Doug Wakabayashi says two low-lying spots on the highway are of concern: One stretch about 52 km north of the E.B. Campbell dam at the north end of Tobin Lake and another stretch 60 km north of the dam.

Highway crews are working in both locations to try and fortify the road, he said. Four-wheel-drive vehicles and trucks should have no problem travelling on the highway, but two-wheel drive vehicles shouldn't try.

In June 2005, all but about 175 residents evacuated from the island community to Nipawin, Saskatoon and Prince Albert when a similar surge of flood waters threatened Cumberland House.

Hastily constructed dikes managed to protect almost everything, but some residents were in evacuation shelters for weeks.

Dwayne Rowlett of the SWA's Nipawin office says three major berms will be constructed in the same places they were built in 2005. Roads and a water treatment plant close to the water are the structures most at risk, he says.

South of Saskatoon, farmland is flooding after the watershed authority had to increase water flows through the Gardiner Dam on Monday. The latest deluge should have the South Saskatchewan River peaking now in the city, Fahlman says, but that could change - yet more rain is expected upstream in Alberta.

For Lynn and William Lemisko, the damage is already done.

Their 35-acre property is part of the 1,000 acres of high-value farmland anticipated to flood after Monday's water release from the dam. The river started creeping onto their neighbours' property on Wednesday and by Thursday, water was flowing onto their crops.

""I'm saying, 'Not again,' and, 'Thanks a lot, Saskatchewan Watershed Authority,' "" said Lynn, whose vegetable operation was also hit hard by floods in 2005.

On Friday, their field was covered. Asparagus, beans, peas, raspberry bushes and fruit trees are under water. Access to the property requires hip-waders. The watershed authority says the flooding could persist for a couple of weeks, which is bad news for WorldAway Farms.

""Even five days and most of the annual crops will be finished,"" Lemisko said. On a good year, the couple makes more than $30,000 selling their vegetables - mainly at the farmers' market. Disaster assistance programs don't cover the cost of lost crops and plants such as asparagus can take three-to-five years to re-establish, she said.

Furthermore, the Lemiskos are building a house on the land, and are worried a stash of building supplies will also be destroyed by flood water. Heavy rain on Friday made it too difficult for the pair to assess the latest damage.

The increase in water through the Gardiner Dam is also prompting the Meewasin Valley Authority to again remind people in Saskatoon to stay away from the river. The South Saskatchewan is moving at about 10 times its normal speed and will be even faster by Sunday.

""Riverbanks will be unstable and many areas have steep dropoffs into a swift current,"" the authority says in a press release. ""Low-lying areas, including some public facilities and trails, may flood.""

The city on Friday temporarily closed a portion of Spadina Crescent between Ravine and Pinehouse drives to cars and pedestrians because of water flowing over the river's banks.

The river is expected to rise almost another metre by Sunday. Sites expected to flood, or that are already flooded, include the trail and lookout behind the Mendel Art Gallery, at least one lookout at River Landing, the Fred Heal canoe launch and all beaches.

Canoeists and private motorboats should also stay off the river to avoid encounters with debris rushing down the river.",2014-05-04T04:52:43.242876,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Loreburn No 254', 'streetAddress': 'HWY-44', 'postalCode': 'S0H', 'formattedAddress': 'HWY-44, Loreburn No 254, SK S0H, Canada'}, 'coords': [-106.869537, 51.268949]}",ijnsUDUiREiYFImz4iljhg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-06-18T03:21:00.000Z,14521-262,ushahidi,"Rain soaks Saskatchewan, new flooding fears","[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'High Water Levels', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:08:02.059558,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Loreburn No 254,"HWY-44, Loreburn No 254, SK S0H, Canada",S0H,HWY-44,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Loreburn No 254', 'streetAddress': 'HWY-44', 'postalCode': 'S0H', 'formattedAddress': 'HWY-44, Loreburn No 254, SK S0H, Canada'}","[-106.869537, 51.268949]",51.268949,-106.869537,Flood Hazards,High Water Levels,,en

2014-05-09 19:08:03.530677,"In northern Saskatchewan, work will begin Saturday to protect the village of Cumberland House from being flooded. It's also getting soggy along the South Saskatchewan River around Saskatoon. 

The water just keeps coming. And heavy rains forecast for Alberta this weekend may make it worse.

The river is already pouring onto the property of the popular greenhouse Floral Acres south of the city. Spencer Mah has worked here his entire life and says he's never seen it this bad. For the past two days workers have been emptying the green house to make sure no plants are damaged, but Mah says the water is also hampering shipping efforts.

""We aren't able to use the semi anymore because half our range is under water, so the semi does not have enough space to get in the back,"" says Mah.

The city is getting hit too. Some areas are starting to show evidence of flooding around the South Saskatchewan River.

Meanwhile Highway #123 to the northern community of Cumberland House is already in bad shape because of the wet spring. The province warns the rising river may flood the highway, isolating the remote town.

As in 2005, berms are being built to protect some homes and buildings in Cumberland House at risk of flooding. Officials say river flows this time may be even higher. Plans are in place to use helicopters to evacuate people with medical emergencies if the road is impassible.

In its most recent report on June 15, the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority (SWA) stated that outflows from Rafferty Dam into the Souris River were 90 cubic metres per second (m3/s), while releases from Boundary Dam were 30 m3/s. Another 20 m3/s was being diverted through the diversion channel from Boundary to Rafferty.

Outflows were reduced from 150 to 120 m3/s on June 10.

""Outflows will be held at this level for some time to mitigate future rain events and build flood storage in Rafferty Reservoir,"" the SWA said. ""Once the immediate threat of rain and maximum reservoir levels subside, the watershed authority will work with affected parties downstream of the reservoir to fine tune a long-term plan to reduce reservoir levels.""

Helen Fornwald, who is the City of Estevan's acting Emergency Planning coordinator, provided Estevan City Council with a flood update during Council's June 13 meeting.

There is too much water in the Estevan area, Fornwald said, and there's nowhere for the water to go. The region needs several weeks without rain. If more rain arrives, Fornwald is concerned that the outflows will increase again.

City manager Jim Puffalt urged people to avoid flocking to flood sites. Protective services personnel and emergency responders have been overworked due to the floods, and the last thing they need is to be rescuing people who encounter problems while watching the water.

The Saskatchewan Ministry of Highways has faced many challenges across the province related to precipitation and a high water table, said spokesperson Doug Wakabayashi. Highway 47 is among those that have been hard hit.

""On the first 20 kilometres from Stoughton to Handsworth, it's a paved surface that has had numerous failures this year,"" said Wakabayashi. ""There are surface failures in about six or seven areas, which are signed and are receiving ongoing temporary maintenance, like blading and adding piece gravel.""

About 5,000 square metres of highway has been deep patched between Stoughton and Handsworth, Wakabayashi said.

Water is on the road for a brief segment of highway between Stoughton and Benson. Traffic has been going through, but the ministry has flag people at the scene. It's too early to tell if any damage has occurred to the highway, Wakabayashi said.

""I think it's just the existing high water table in the area made worse by the recent rainfalls,"" said Wakabayashi.

Highway 47 south of Stoughton was resurfaced in 2009.

Since the roads are saturated, the Ministry of Highways can't do permanent repairs, Wakabayashi said. So they have prioritized emergency temporary repairs to keep roads open.

Highways 361 and 318 in the Alida area have suffered damage, too. So has Highway 8 south of Redvers.

2014-05-09 19:08:03.349661,"Five families have been evacuated from Carry the Kettle First Nation as the community has declared a state of emergency.

Many of the First Nation’s roads have been washed out due to spring melt and rainfall, leaving some people stranded in their homes for up to two months, said Chief Ivan Thomson Jr. Of 200 homes on the First Nation, 75 have been affected.

Two families were evacuated Monday, according to Amanda Ulrich of the Red Cross. Twenty-two other people were moved to Regina on Friday. The Red Cross will provide food and shelter until at least Thursday, when the situation will be reassessed.

Thomson declared a state of emergency at 1:30 p.m. on Friday.

“Our roads are under water right now, a fair number of them, so it’s affecting a lot of things. There’s big land bases of water, lakes that haven’t been there before,” said Thomson.

A public meeting was held Monday evening to unveil the disaster plan for the First Nation, which is about 90 kilometres east of Regina.

“We’ve got quads, we’ve got people ready with horseback, possibly boats if we have to,” said Thomson. “We called Transcanada Pipelines and asked them if they can have a helicopter on hand if we need anything, to get people out of their homes in case of emergency ...

“All weekend long we’ve been assessing the situation, monitoring everything, trying to drain some big sloughs and big lakes,” said Thomson. “To move the water, we’ve been breaking up beaver dams as best we can to keep the flow going, but it’s bad.

“I’ve got people driving on the roads into their homes and they’re getting hung up. A lot of them, brakes, transmissions are giving out ...”

Thomson said the community has been working on flood prevention since the spring melt began, to little avail.

“We put a lot of effort in place to build (the roads) up, but every time it rains we’re back at square one. It doesn’t give us time to get moving on anything,” he said. “We’ve been utilizing some outside farmers and their equipment to help on our roads; (people from) local communities like Montmartre bring in gravel, bring in rock; we’ve been building up our roads, digging holes, getting clay in, and we’re going to have to start looking at railway ties for some areas.”

Thomson said some elderly people have been stranded in their homes, and children have missed school because the bus can’t get down the roads to pick them up. “If they have quads and other means they can get around that way, but a lot of them don’t ...

2014-05-09 19:08:03.442824,"Despite another weekend of heavy rain, the flood situation along the Souris River is improving.
After reaching its peak earlier this month, the river has been receding gradually in the days since. There were fears that the roughly two inches of rain Estevan and area received over the weekend could cause the river to swell again but John Fahlman of the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority said that won’t be the case.

“The rain came, the inflows were the same as a couple of weeks ago but we got the reservoirs down far enough before (the rain) that we could store it in there and not have to increase the flows back up to what they were,” said Fahlman in an interview Tuesday morning.

“We have some storage in the (Boundary and Rafferty) reservoirs so we feel comfortable that we can drop the flows and leave them there going forward until the reservoirs come down quite a bit.”
As of Tuesday morning, Fahlman said Boundary was sitting near its full supply level and releasing water into the Souris River at a rate of 40 cubic metres per second. However they planned to drop that outflow down to 20 m3/s later in the day. Rafferty was flowing at 30 m3/s as of Tuesday and Fahlman said there were no plans to make any changes in the immediate future.

“That will mean 50 m3/s coming out of the reservoirs,” said Fahlman. “Over the next day, to two days, as the valley drains, (the river) should go back and stay within the channel. As far as we can tell, we are going to be able to leave it there unless we get another rain storm like this and right now it doesn’t look like that is on the horizon. 

“As Boundary inflows drop we will eventually turn that off but will increase Rafferty releases to make up for what we turn it down. Basically we just want to get the reservoirs down.”

Although there is some storage space in Rafferty to handle any future rainfalls, provided they aren’t too large, Fahlman said the best thing for area would be some dry weather.

“I would like the landscape to get a chance to breathe and drain off a bit, maybe the ground dry up a bit,” he said. “If we get another two inches in a week we might have to bump it up again but we looked at the weather modelling this morning and right now it is not saying that.”",2014-05-04T04:52:52.579033,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Estevan', 'streetAddress': '802 6th St', 'postalCode': 'S4A', 'formattedAddress': '802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada'}, 'coords': [-102.986111, 49.139167]}",5dlXbWJWSAeH19m7Gq1SQA,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-05-24T22:03:00.000Z,14521-250,ushahidi,Flood situation improving - Estevan Mercury,"[{'name': 'Flood Preparedness', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:08:03.442824,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Estevan,"802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada",S4A,802 6th St,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Estevan', 'streetAddress': '802 6th St', 'postalCode': 'S4A', 'formattedAddress': '802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada'}","[-102.986111, 49.139167]",49.139167,-102.986111,Flood Preparedness,,,en
2014-05-09 19:08:03.623900,"Flood victims in the Estevan area have some good news after a long couple of weeks.

The water has started to come down.

On Friday, the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority is slowing the flows coming out of a dam upstream.

Greg Hoffart with the local RM says the ease in flows should hopefully give residents who aren’t flooded a little breathing room.

But not everyone agrees that's the best way to go.

Homeowner Rod Benning says the water got just two feet from his home, and even as the water starts to ease off he'll keep sandbags and berms right where they are.

“Right now, it’s going to stay there until I personally know they have room in that dam,” he said.

“I have an island house. I probably have four feet of water around my house.”

Hoffart said just south of Estevan, roughly seven homes went under water this week.

The Saskatchewan government is also mobilizing a team of counsellors to flood-ravaged areas, according the province’s Duane McKay.

He says some people just need to vent their frustrations.

2014-05-09 19:08:02.905748,"The Souris River's rising flood waters have forced the RM of Estevan to declare itself a disaster area, and to issue a state of emergency.

The disaster area designation came on May 10; the state of emergency happened the following day. Reeve Kelly Lafrentz said the RM was expecting water levels along the Souris River to be a metre to a metre-and-a-half higher than they were during the previous flood in mid-April.

Lafrentz said the water levels were expected to reach their peak sometime on May 11, which was less than 48 hours after 51 millimetres of rain – equal to a little more than two inches – fell on Estevan on May 8 and 9.

An evacuation alert was issued for RM residents who live downstream of Rafferty Dam and Boundary Dam.

“We've advised people to prepare an evacuation plan and have themselves ready to evacuate,” said Lafrentz. “But it would be a voluntary evacuation. If they feel they're safe, they can stay there until they feel they're threatened.

Lafrentz believed that one home has been evacuated, and 25 more could be forced to flee.

The state of emergency will allow the RM to recoup some of the costs associated with the floods. If there isn't any more precipitation, Lafrentz anticipates that the state of emergency could be lifted in a few days.

RM of Estevan administrator Greg Hoffort said damage to the Woodlawn Regional Park is more severe than what occurred in April. The Doug Third Hall and some of the other buildings escaped flood damage last month, but virtually all of Woodlawn's buildings will have some water seep in this time.

“The campground is completely under water,” said Hoffort.

If not for the latest round of flooding, Woodlawn Regional would have likely been ready for the Victoria Day long weekend, Hoffort said. Now he doesn't know when the park will be open.

A 72-site campground near Boundary Dam hasn't been affected by flooding, Hoffort said, and a decision will be made soon on when that campground will be open.

The City of Estevan has been forced to close several flooded roads on the outskirts of the community: Woodlawn Avenue South from Westview Place to Highway 18; 4th Avenue South from the Brick Plant Road to Highway 47; the Brick Plant Road; River Road south of the city; and the landfill access road.

City of Estevan safety coordinator Helen Fornwald said that people can still use the Brick Plant road to access the Estevan Humane Society's building, and that River Road is open to local traffic.

Public Works employees constructed a new and higher berm at the Willow Park Greens Trailer Park on May 10 to protect homes at the south end.

“We're very confident that it is high enough now,” said Fornwald.

Large pools of water that formed at the home park's south edge have subsided, Fornwald said.

Releases from Rafferty Dam into the Souris River were at 110 cubic metres per second as of May 11. Boundary Dam's releases measured 70 metres per second. The combined outflow was 180 cubic metres per second, which is considerably higher than the amount seen in April.

Rafferty Dam is at its maximum allowable flood level of 554 metres, which means that outflows must, at the minimum, match inflows.

2014-05-09 19:08:03.257010,"Joe Gervais and other residents of Bienfait are scrambling to pump water out of basements following heavy rain on Tuesday.

Bienfait, a town approximately 200 kilometres southeast of Regina, is the 15th Saskatchewan community to declare a state of emergency.

Gervais took the day off of work to try and clean up the damage.

""It's really disheartening,"" said Gervais. ""There is not a lot someone can do other than just clean up the mess as much as you can.""

Despite finishing flood prevention measures on April 6, which included clearing water from roads and ditches, the only pumping station in Bienfait stopped working on Tuesday and the town issued a boil-water advisory.

Gervais said the biggest difficulty for residents is trying to get pumps, and he wishes the situation was handled better.

""By that time phone calls were made, the extent of the damages was already bad,"" said Gervais. ""There are about 12 or 13 people up the street that are trying to get as much water out of their basements as they can.""

Jamie Bonokoski, mayor of Bienfait, said he was expecting crews to help Wednesday afternoon but there is a waiting list for hydrovac trucks.

""I don't think it could have been prevented,"" said Bonokoski. ""The water was coming in at a level that we just couldn't maintain. We are looking at perhaps adding another pump, but the way the system operates there is no control over it. It was basically flooding, no matter what.""

Bonokoski said victims of flooding should document all damage, take pictures and keep all receipts.

""Right now we are getting in contact with the government to see if they can fund us in anyway or help out any of the residents that were affected,"" he said.

Estevan is also experiencing flooding after receiving over two inches of rain on Monday and Tuesday.

There are significant worries for people along the Souris River south of Estevan because increased water is being released from both the Boundary Dam and the Rafferty Dam reservoirs. Both reservoirs are at maximum water levels. Inflows to Alameda Reservoir have also increased and it is expected to reach maximum flood level by Tuesday.

Johnson said water levels in the Souris River will increase to about 1.5 metres.

""This is going to continue likely for a week as we see these inflows go through the reservoirs and proceed down stream,"" said Johnson.

The increased outflow of water will have a major impact on the properties in the Souris River valley. Workers were sandbagging along sections of Highways 18 and 47 near Estevan to try and protect homes.

Duane McKay, director of emergency response for the Ministry of Corrections, Public Safety and Policing, said several residents are being prepared for evacuation.

""We have identified six families in the particular area that have potential of being flooded and, although work has been done to protect their residences, they have been put on self-evacuation notice.""

In the Roche Percee area, 30 families have been identified as potential evacuees.

As of Wednesday morning, 62 communities were designated disaster areas.

""This is a very major flood event,"" said Johnson. ""Putting it in terms of flood frequency, it's at least a one-in-a-100-year flood event and perhaps higher than that as the numbers evolve.""",2014-05-04T04:52:47.953617,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Bienfait', 'postalCode': 'S0C', 'formattedAddress': 'Bienfait, SK S0C, Canada'}, 'coords': [-102.801003, 49.14257]}",rQhi5qQ9Sni9RPBw67h-6w,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-05-12T02:52:00.000Z,14521-244,ushahidi,Bienfait in state of emergency,"[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:08:03.257010,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Bienfait,"Bienfait, SK S0C, Canada",S0C,,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Bienfait', 'postalCode': 'S0C', 'formattedAddress': 'Bienfait, SK S0C, Canada'}","[-102.801003, 49.14257]",49.14257,-102.801003,Flood Hazards,,,en
2014-05-09 19:08:03.796532,"With reservoirs full and water rising, the rural municipality of Estevan has declared a new state of emergency.

Some 60 people are on voluntary evacuation notice in the RM in southeast Saskatchewan.

Estevan received 41 millimetres of rain on Tuesday, adding more water to the Boundary and Rafferty reservoirs.

""[We] have advised everyone in the RM in the low-lying areas to evacuate or be ready to evacuate if the waters continue to rise,"" said Kelly Lafrentz, the reeve of the RM of Estevan. ""We expect that's going to happen.""

More water will have to be let out of the reservoirs, because they're near capacity, and that will cause the Souris River to rise.

It's hard to tell exactly what will flood, said Lafrentz, who added that he's never seen anything like this in his life.

Many homes in the area were under water two weeks ago when the first state of emergency was declared, but that water receded.

2014-05-09 19:08:03.972568,"As the rain continues to fall, the worries continue to grow for those along the Souris River south of Estevan and further downstream.

Due in large part to the major snowstorm earlier this month and the rain that pelted the area Monday and Tuesday, the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority has been forced to increase the flow of water it is releasing into the Souris River from both the Boundary Dam and Rafferty Dam Reservoirs. 

As of late last week, the SWA was releasing at a rate of 85 cubic metres per second from Rafferty. However, during the provincial flood conference call Monday, Doug Johnson of the watershed authority said if southeast Saskatchewan receives the two inches of rain that had been forecast, the authority would be forced to up the release from both reservoirs. If that happened, he predicted the Souris River could rise by as much as one metre, creating a much bigger problem for people who are already doing their best to hold the water back.

“If (the rain) materializes, we are going to see flows rise on the river systems and water levels will rise on the reservoirs and the lakes,” said Johnson. “It is very much going to depend on how much rainfall we have and how it develops as to what the water level rises are going to be on the rivers and the lakes.

“With Rafferty being very close to the maximum allowable flood level, we are anticipating that the flows will increase very significantly through Estevan as we have to pass on the inflows. If that happens, we could see water levels rise by as much as a metre. That will have a major impact on the properties that were combating the floods and on the infrastructure in the river valley. It will be an issue.”

Although the rainfall will dictate how much and when they will increase flows, Johnson warned that by today, flows from the two reservoirs could be a combined 200 m3/s into the Souris. How long they will have to keep up that release will also depend on the rainfall.

“We have got to get the inflows down on both Rafferty and Boundary in order to start dropping the flow releases out.”

The increase in flows is causing some major headaches in low-lying areas south of Estevan and further downstream.

Locally, a significant portion of Woodlawn Park has flooded for a second time. Homeowners across from Woodlawn have also been forced into action again, building dikes around their property and sandbagging. 
Johnson also noted Sherritt Coal has been impacted as one of their roads which is used to haul coal has been closed due to flooding.

The Village of Roche Percee is also on high alert for the second time this spring. Deputy Mayor Sharon Wells there are a handful of areas in the village that have been flooded and they are continuing to keep a close watch on the river.

“We still have our sandbags and we are in the process of looking for pumps,” said Wells. “We have an area down by the village office where it is coming back in from the river and we are going to try and pump that out to the east and hopefully save that lady from flooding.

“There are homes to the southeast (of the village office) their backyard is full of water and the water is going from behind those two homes across to the homes behind Division Avenue in the ballpark area. We are getting water from everywhere.”

While speaking to The Mercury on Monday, Wells said the current release from the reservoirs is causing the river to rise by six inches a day. She added they have roughly three feet of space before the river hits the bridge.

“But we do have our sandbags there still and we have sandbags dropped off in various parts along the dike and throughout the village. But what good is that going to do if they increase the flow?”

Wells added that an information meeting was held Monday in Bienfait by the Provincial Disaster Assistance Program which was attended from officials from Roche Percee, Lampman, Benson and various rural municipalities that are being impacted by overland flooding. 

According to anecdotal reports, a significant amount of farmland in the southeast is under water and there are serious concerns that if the area continues to receive precipitation many farmers will be unable to plant a crop this year.",2014-05-04T04:52:58.386478,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Estevan', 'streetAddress': '802 6th St', 'postalCode': 'S4A', 'formattedAddress': '802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada'}, 'coords': [-102.986111, 49.139167]}",kxK5UNuqT4WB9v6o6XIjOg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-05-10T22:07:00.000Z,14521-236,ushahidi,Rain worsens flood concerns in Estevan,"[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}, {'name': 'High Water Levels', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:08:03.972568,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Estevan,"802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada",S4A,802 6th St,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Estevan', 'streetAddress': '802 6th St', 'postalCode': 'S4A', 'formattedAddress': '802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada'}","[-102.986111, 49.139167]",49.139167,-102.986111,Flood Hazards,High Water Levels,,en
2014-05-09 19:08:04.344876,"The forecast for significant rainfall in the coming days is causing dark clouds of concern over eastern Saskatchewan.

""We're anticipating seeing as much as two inches of rain, 50 millimetres of rain, in the Weyburn, Yorkton, Broadview, Estevan area - so very widespread on the eastern side of the province,"" said Doug Johnson of the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority during Monday's provincial flood update.

""If it all materializes, we are going to see flows rise on the river systems and water levels will rise on the reservoirs and on the lakes.""

Currently, the Rafferty Reservoir is near the maximum flood level of 554 metres. With little storage remaining, and rainfall forecast until Wednesday, outflows from the Rafferty Reservoir must be increased.

The Souris River's level could rise by more than one metre in Estevan and area.

""That will have major impacts on the properties that were combating the floods and the infrastructure in the river valley,"" Johnson said.

Residents in the river valley are being advised to prepare to protect themselves and their property.

Flows on the Souris River have already caused property problems in Estevan. The road SaskPower uses to haul coal from the north side of the river to Boundary power station was closed Sunday, Johnson said.

Water levels on the Qu'Appelle River system are dropping - except for Last Mountain Lake.

""All of the lakes have peaked with the exception of Last Mountain Lake, which is continuing a very slow rise,"" Johnson said. ""The flows downstream of Round Lake are still fairly high, but they are dropping.""

Staff from the Corrections, Public Safety, and Policing ministry are keeping a close eye on the Estevan area to manage peak flows. They're also working with First Nations such as Cowessess, Sakimay, and Ochapowace - all of which have reported road damage because of recent flooding.

Services in some provincial parks are being disrupted by flooding.

Campers are advised to check www.saskparks.net before heading out to a provincial park on or before the May long weekend.

Rowan's Ravine and Katepwa Point provincial parks and Regina Beach's recreation site will remain closed to the public until June.

Park boat launch and fish filleting facilities at Buffalo Pound, Echo Valley, Katepwa Point, Crooked Lake and Rowan's Ravine provincial parks and Regina Beach recreation site will not be operating until further notice.

Parks staff will contact seasonal campers and those with reservations in the affected parks.

Flows through Estevan will increase and will likely reach or exceed the levels experienced earlier in the spring. Depending on the actual rainfall flows may exceed the earlier peak flows.

Storage in Rafferty Reservoir has been used to significantly reduce downstream flooding from the spring melt. However, the large volume of water in the 2011 snow pack has filled the reservoir above full supply level and it is now near the maximum flood elevation of 554 metres.

""Roads have washed out all over and we've been having to cut roads and culverts have been washed out,"" she explained in an interview Friday morning, noting that has made it difficult just to get around in the area. ""Today we're starting to see it slow down a bit. We haven't had many roads close today but yesterday and the day before definitely were the days that were the worst, I guess.""

So far the RM office has received calls from at least 20 property owners have seen flooding or dead cattle as a result.

""That's maybe at the low end of things,"" she admitted. ""That's just what we've heard and there's still got people calling us today to see what they can do.""

The declaration should mean those who have been impacted can now apply for the province's disaster assistance program.

2014-05-09 19:08:04.439846,"Now that water has started to recede in Wascana Creek, the City of Regina is removing some of its temporary diking and sharing it with residents and communities that are still experiencing flooding.

The city is sharing approximately 1,000 feet of its 50-foot-long tiger dams with Katepwa emergency response personnel to assist them in their fight against the rising lake levels.

Warren Bobbee, emergency planning co-ordinator for the district of Katepwa, said it was an exciting day on Thursday because Katepwa received some assistance from Regina and Saskatoon. He said the City of Regina's timing couldn't be better.

""For the last two or three days we've been looking at how we can continue to recover on East and West Maples and at the same time sustaining the berms at Boyle and Sandy Beach,"" said Bobbee. ""For the three of the residents that we had evacuated, we were looking at finding a product that we could try to surround those properties and start pumping out the water.""

The Tiger Dams - bright orange inflatable tubes that are quicker to install than sandbags - have been taken to Katepwa Lake. The dams had been located on Wascana Creek in Rotary Park.

Bobbee expected all the dams to be put in place by the end of the day on Thursday.

""It's just absolutely amazing that we can be doing this and at the same time sustaining the berms in other places,"" said Bobbee. ""We can get the residents back into their houses quicker than we thought.""

Bobbee said it's important to get the residences dried out as quickly as possible to avoid the possibility of mould developing.

He said the City of Saskatoon's Fire and Water Rescue Team set out on the lake at 8 a.m. on Thursday.

""They are doing a circuit to check 20 feet from shoreline and identifying any large objects and pulling out any large objects,"" said Bobbee. ""We don't want these logs, pieces of boat houses and doors, and we've seen barrels to be a torpedo.""

The City of Regina is also sharing sandbags from along 17th Avenue with Regina residents. The City assumes no liability associated with loading and transporting the sandbags.

The bags can be picked up along 17th Avenue from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily until May 13. Residents are asked to use the Pasqua Street entrance.

Although the water has started to recede, Wascana Lake and Wascana Creek are still dangerous and will remain so for the next few weeks. Residents are being asked to stay back from the water and to keep their children away from open water. It's also important to keep dogs on a leash when close to bodies of water.

If you see anyone near dangerous water, call the Regina Police Service at 777-6500.

Reiter said maintenance work will be stepped up to address breaks, cracks and potholes.

The minister added that the condition of many roads will not be fully known until flood waters recede and crews can assess what impact that had on highway side slopes, roadbeds and road surfaces.

""The province will be making repairs to the highway network, and we have crews, contractors, materials and equipment at the ready,"" Reiter promised.

He cautioned, however, that the work will take time.

In some places temporary repairs will be made, with complete fixes having to wait until the roads are dry.

2014-05-09 19:08:04.956229,"The Saskatchewan Watershed Authority is warning that another round of flooding is possible along the Souris River.

The SWA issued an advisory Wednesday informing the public that because of the heavy, wet snow that fell on Estevan area over the weekend, they will be forced to increase flows out of Rafferty Dam into the Souris. Flows from Rafferty are currently 65 cubic metres a second but will be increased to at least 100 m3/s on Thursday. That is the same rate as earlier this spring when water was released from Boundary Dam and caused significant flooding in low lying areas such as Woodlawn Regional Park.

The SWA has been using Rafferty for flood storage this spring to reduce downstream flooding from the spring melt. However, they note the large volume of water in the 2011 snow pack has filled the reservoir above the full supply level and it is now near its maximum flood elevation of 554 metres.

Because they have little in the way of storage remaining and a rapid increase in inflow because of the weekend blizzard the SWA says the release out of Rafferty must be increased Thursday and will remain at a high level until flows into the reservoir decrease sufficiently. They also warned that any increase in flow, be it from rain or snow, may require further increases in outflow.

The City of Estevan, Village of Roche Percee and RM of Estevan have been notified about the increases. The public is also reminded to stay away from the fast moving water and take steps to protect themselves and their property.

Estevan and area was hit with a fierce spring storm Saturday that dropped over 36 centimetres of heavy, wet snow on the area and caused a number of problems from paralyzing traffic to knocking out power to over 1,000 SaskPower customers.

The City of Estevan has also announced it is closing Fourth Avenue at the Brick Plant Road and that access will only be for local traffic. The Estevan Police Service is asking for the public's co-operation in the matter and are requesting they do not drive on Fourth Avenue south of the Brick Plant Road.",2014-05-04T04:53:10.095295,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Estevan', 'streetAddress': '802 6th St', 'postalCode': 'S4A', 'formattedAddress': '802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada'}, 'coords': [-102.986111, 49.139167]}",uoy11cT9QtqxlutcecMfZg,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-05-04T14:28:00.000Z,14521-226,ushahidi,Another round of flooding possible south of Estevan,"[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:08:04.956229,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Estevan,"802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada",S4A,802 6th St,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Estevan', 'streetAddress': '802 6th St', 'postalCode': 'S4A', 'formattedAddress': '802 6th St, Estevan, SK S4A, Canada'}","[-102.986111, 49.139167]",49.139167,-102.986111,Flood Hazards,,,en
2014-05-09 19:08:04.076640,"Bob Bjornerud went from dealing with weather-related disasters in government to overseeing a disaster in his own backyard.

""You sure see both sides when it happens to you,"" he said.

Bjornerud, the minister of agriculture, and MLA for Melville-Saltcoats, said his farm east of Yorkton was hit hard by spring runoff and a weekend snowstorm.

""In my yard here we have 10 acres and I would guess there is probably 9 1 ?2 under water,"" said Bjornerud. ""I have to stay home because we are trying to save our basement.""

For Bjornerud, spending day and night fighting to save his basement highlighted the need for disasterrelief programs.

He noted the $22 million set aside at the beginning of the year for the Emergency Flood Damage Reduction Program to protect home and permanent structures against flood damage. Bjornerud said more assistance may be made available but that such weather-related disasters are sometimes beyond the government's control.

""I live in a farming community and I think we always have that attitude that we'll get through it,"" he said. ""We've done it before and we'll get through it again.""

Despite the water lapping up against his house, Bjornerud said he's luckier than others.

""It's one of those things that could be a lot worse,"" said Bjornerud. ""I was down in the valley last week at Crooked Lake and Round Lake and they have got some bad situations down there.""

Trevor Crozier spent the entire weekend fighting to save his cabin at Grenfell Beach on Crooked Lake, a place his family has been going to for over 30 years.

""I'm not sure if shocking is even the right word,"" said Crozier. ""It's something I've never imagined.""

When Crozier received a notice that water was going to be released into Crooked Lake, he planned to start piling thousands of sandbags the next day. The water ended up rising approximately 26 inches in only 24 hours.

""That's when we knew we were in big trouble,"" he said.

When the power went out for 58 hours on the weekend, Crozier's sump pump stopped working and his utility room flooded.

""It's emotionally draining for lots of people,"" he said. ""One of the families there lost their place in the storm even after sandbagging and putting up big water berms.""

Crozier still considers himself one of the lucky ones.

""I've lost quite a bit of landscaping which, in the big picture, is pretty minimal,"" he said. ""There are people that have lost cottages and I don't know what kind of disaster assistance they're going to get.""

Doug Johnson of the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority said it has been watching the Qu'Appelle River system very closely. Water levels rose three centimetres from Monday.

A section of the westbound lanes of the Trans-Canada Highway 14 kilometres east of Grenfell was closed Tuesday due to potential culvert failure and water flowing onto the road. The eastbound lanes accommodated two-way traffic for the day and the westbound lanes were expected to reopen last night.

At Grenfell Beach, they expect to see local streams pick up in the area because of the snowfall.

""There is a handful of us left that are fighting it,"" said Crozier. ""It's devastating. It's tough to see the emotions of the people that are there that did lose everything.

Bob Bjornerud, Saskatchewan's minister of agriculture, said Tuesday that his own Yorkton-area farming operation is partially under water, in part because of the weekend snowstorm.

""It's lapping up against two walls here,"" Bjornerud said about the condition of one of his buildings. ""We would have sandbagged, but it come up so quick since yesterday.""

He added that farmers across the district are concerned about saturated fields and pools of runoff water, with spring seeding just weeks or days away from starting in earnest.

""We got a foot and a half of that snow in that storm the other night,"" he said. ""It was just full of water. And as it melts now, you know the system just can't take it so it's backing up everywhere.""

Wind was the concern, again, for people at Katepwa Lake east of Regina. Strong winds on the weekend pushed waves through some protective berms.

Since then, the community has been fortifying berms to avoid a repeat.

Almost 50 homes and cottages on Sandy Beach Point are currently protected by a wall of sandbags.

Officials say wind on the lake can produce damaging wave action.

2014-05-09 19:08:05.139574,"Flood concerns in the Southwest are easing thanks to cooperation from Mother Nature.

On Monday, the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority stated the risk of a very high flood peak is declining along the Frenchman River watershed because of favourable weather. Cool temperatures have allowed for a steady runoff which boasts high volumes without the peak flows. The snowpack in the upper portion of the watershed remains heavy, but must of the runoff from the lower areas has occurred or is well underway.

They are still forecasting Cypress Lake will fill this year, and at one meter below the full supply level it is at its highest level since 1972.

Flows on Lodge Creek at the Saskatchewan/US border is 15 cubic meters per second, down from a peak of 45 cubic meters per second on April 28.

Water flows at Ravenscrag, upstream from Eastend was flowing at a rate of 19 cubic meters per second on Monday, dropping more than half from the 40 cubic meters per second flow on April 29.

Area residents are invited to pick up sandbags from the inventory stored at the Recreation Centre for use in flower beds and sandboxes. Residents who put sandbags around their homes and no longer require them are also invited to drop them off at the Recreation Centre.

“We had a tremendous community effort in terms of filling sandbags, and with the extra inventory no longer needed we want to let the public know that they are more than welcome to come by the Recreation Centre and pick up as many as desired, free of charge,” noted City of Swift Current CAO Susan Motkaluk.

As ice melts, the water remains at or near peak levels through the Qu'Apelle River system, running northwest of Regina and east toward southern Manitoba, the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority warned Friday.

Sandbags should be at least six metres high due to potential wind and waves, it said.

Strong winds have already caused problems for sandbag berms near cottages at Katepwa Lake, east of Regina.

2014-05-09 19:08:05.890030,"Strong prairie winds have pushed water through a section of sandbag berms that were protecting homes and cabins on Katepwa Lake, east of Regina.

Wind gusts that reached 60 kilometres an hour on Friday night whipped up the water on the lake, which has been rising precipitously for the past week.

""The waves just kept coming in and took down the wall and all the hard work that everybody put in for the last two weeks,"" Don Ferguson, a local cabin owner, told CBC News on Saturday. ""It's unbelievable.""

Local officials said 37 properties flooded. Of those, 11 were permanent homes. A voluntary evacuation was in place for the flooded area.

Ferguson said that at one point, lake water was pouring down onto people working on the dry side of the berm.

A line of sand bags is barely visible under the wave action on Katepwa Lake. About 60 metres of the barrier failed, leading to the flooding of 37 properties. Kent Morrison/CBC""It's amazing what Mother Nature can do,"" he said. Water 15 centimetres deep covered the main floor of his cabin.

""There's three or four of us along here that have all got it inside the cottages. I've never seen it like this.""

One neighbour is on high ground and is dry, but some shingles on the house were blown off in the strong wind.

Water from Katepwa Lake was pushed over a sandbag berm due to wind action Friday night. Kent Morrisson/CBCWarren Bobbee, emergency planning co-ordinator for the District of Katepwa, told CBC News that community members are nearly exhausted after two weeks of fighting the water.

The community had constructed a sandbag barrier of some 2,000 metres along the lakeshore that stood about 1.5 metres high in some sections.

""After we completed that,"" Bobbee said, ""we then had to use our volunteers and go back for that same amount and lift those berms up.""

Bobbee said that even with the additional height, the wind pushed the lake water over the top.

About 60 metres of the berm washed away around 9 p.m. CT.

""We lost one that we couldn't fix,"" Bobbee said, noting that community members were working throughout the day Friday to shore up the berms in anticipation of the heavy winds.

Volunteers were out in force Saturday, adding more sandbags to the berm at Katepwa Lake. Kent Morrisson/CBC On Saturday, volunteers were scrambling to rebuild sections battered by waves. The stretch that was flooded over, however, was too dangerous to reach.

Power has been cut off to the affected buildings.

In addition to the wave action, the lake level has also been rising. The water was up by about 2.5 centimetres on Friday and was expected to rise another 7.5 centimetres in the days ahead.

Bobbee said if the wind does not decrease or change direction, there could be more flooding.",2014-05-04T04:53:23.884226,,"{'addressComponents': {'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Abernethy No 186', 'postalCode': 'S0A', 'formattedAddress': 'Abernethy No 186, SK, Canada'}, 'coords': [-103.663918, 50.732076]}",O0LFKkqZS1KDT_rfomWgmw,"{'name': 'English', 'nativeName': 'English', 'code': 'en'}",unknown,temporary,2011-04-30T13:24:00.000Z,14521-219,ushahidi,Flood barrier broken by wind at Katepwa Lake,"[{'name': 'Flood Hazards', 'confidence': 1}]",2014-05-09 19:08:05.890030,Canada,SK,Saskatchewan,Abernethy No 186,"Abernethy No 186, SK, Canada",S0A,,"{'adminArea3': 'SK', 'adminArea1': 'Canada', 'adminArea4': 'Saskatchewan', 'adminArea5': 'Abernethy No 186', 'postalCode': 'S0A', 'formattedAddress': 'Abernethy No 186, SK, Canada'}","[-103.663918, 50.732076]",50.732076,-103.663918,Flood Hazards,,,en

I saw evidence of increased coverage in fields since Saturday and the rainfall certainly seem to perk up the blooms. Fields with a northern or northeastern face seem to be doing the best right now. 

Along JC Spence RD there is a really nice field that has easy access. The blooms are fresh with little signs of any seed pods. 

Found several other fields along side roads. I will post a report with photos for each of those areas later.  

If you plan to visit Ennis this year, I would strongly advise going this week. The Garden club Bluebonnet festival is this coming weekend 4/15-17 and it looks like there will be bluebonnets for the festival.

2014-05-09 19:08:10.245448,"Although not entirely equal to the show of 2007, this year's Ennis Bluebonnets are putting on the best wildflower show in Texas this season. The Ennis show is also the only show still running. Bluebonnets in the Brenham area are already going to seed.  

Today (Saturday, 4/9/2011), I had the pleasure of experiencing several vista views of bluebonnets stretching over several acres. The sights and scents have ""reconnected"" me to our Texas State Flower. 

The show is coming to end soon. The heat and dry weather are advancing the seeding process. If you want to experience the best and only bluebonnet show in Texas, you should get out to Ennis this week. Unless the area gets a good soaking rain (there is 40% chance tomorrow), the curtain could come down in the next 7-10 days. 

I am very glad I jumped in the car and came now rather than my original plan around Easter time. 

Attached image: Old Bluebonnet Park (the new Bluebonnet Park does not have bluebonnets).

2014-05-09 19:08:10.158493,"The ten acre field previously reported in Waller is very thick and in full bloom. It is just a few blocks past Myrtle Avenue on right side of Penick Road. There is nothing else of note in this area. 

Industry is pretty much a none-event this year. The one exception is a partial bluebonnet field at TX159 and FM2754. There was another nice field of bluebonnets along FM2754 that I could actually smell them.

 There are a few nice spots of phlox in Kenny but almost no flowers along Phillipsburg Church Road. There are a few partially covered bluebonnet fields along TX36 south of Brenham. The TXDOT bluebonnets along US290 between Brenham and Burton are about the same as they were two weeks ago. 

If you take the first Burton exit at Spur 125 and then the first right there is a small but nice unrestricted bluebonnet field. Scenic 390 is the best bluebonnet viewing of the areas visited Sunday, 4/3/11. And the best of the best were the fields along Zibilski Road between FM2679 and Quail Run Road. They are not as outstanding as years past but still pretty darn good. 

Old Baylor is not great but there are bluebonnet fields on both sides of it that had traffic backed up for photos. 

A nice surprise was the ride home on TX105 from Navasota to Montgomery where the TXDOT bluebonnets along the highway were very nice with a few really nice bluebonnet fields. Notable is a field across from Montgomery High School and one on the other side of town in front of a new subdivision. 

It is still pretty dry but the wildflowers are trying their best to put on a good show! I'll try to get some photos up tomorrow or Tuesday and do another map report.

FM  1382 near Cedar Hill State Park has started showing lots of blue, 
with more to come in the next few days

Hwy 76 at FM 1382 in Cedar Hill has a nice stand of bluebonnets beginning.

I20 in the area from 360 east to FM 1382 has spotty bluebonnets due to 
the construction.

And Carrier Parkway going north at I30 has a nice stand.  Hard to stop
