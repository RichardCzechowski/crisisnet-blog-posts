into the country.

According to The News (a newspaper), the Senate Health Committee Chairman Peter Coleman said he does not support state of emergency that would lead to the closure of various borders with Liberia.  Senator Coleman argued that the prevailing Ebola virus situation in Liberia does not warrant a state of emergency, noting that Liberia is a part of a region where collective heath, commence and security are linked in the Mano River region and in the ECOWAS region. Hence, the closure of borders would create more problems for the country than good because people suspected of having the virus will take advantage of illegal entries to enter the country.
